TROUBLESHOOTING:

The information below should solve many of your problems installing
or running Exile III: Ruined World...

Question:  Exile III refuses to install!
Answer: First, make sure you have ten megabytes of free space on the 
drive you're trying to install to (the game takes up 7, but the 
installer needs a little extra space). Then reboot, make sure no other 
programs are running, and try installing Exile III again. If this 
doesn't work, your download may be corrupted. Try redownloading.

Question:  Exile III crashes sometimes for no reason!
Answer: Several steps to try, which will eliminate many problems.
1. Select Preferences from the File menu. Select Fewer Sounds. If 
this doesn't help, turn off sounds. This will fix most problems.
2. Run Exile III with no other programs running.
3. Make sure you have 3 megabytes of free RAM.

Question:  I get crashes when targeting a spell or missile, and nothing 
helps!
Answer: Select Preferences from the File menu. Select No Targeting
Line.

Question:  The Exile III screen is really tiny!
Answer: Go into Windows preferences, and select a monitor mode with a 
different resolution. 640x480 is recommended. (On windows 95, right 
click on the desktop, select Properties, and click on the settings
tab.)

Question: The Exile III screen colors are all bizarre!
Answer:  You need to play Exile III in 256 color mode. Run Exile III, 
hit F1 (for help), and read the section on troubleshooting to find 
out how to get 256 colors on your screen.

Question:  OK. I installed the game. It runs fine. It looks fine. But I
keep starving, if the monsters don't kill me first, and I don't have any 
gold!
Answer:  Read the Hints For Getting Started section near the end of the 
manual (hit F1 to get the manual).

Question: Sometimes, when I switch to another window and
switch back to Exile III, the colors are all strange.
Answer: One of the other programs you're running is messing with Exile
III's color management. Quit everything else you're using (including the
fancy front-end programs some computers come with) and try running Exile
III again.
