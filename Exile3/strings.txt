Exile III is designed for 256 colors. The current graphics device is set for less. Exile 3 is playable with less colors, but will look somewhat odd.
Not 256 colors!

The reaction is set into motion ...
You fools!
           What have you done?
Curse you!
My fortress
is lost!
But you shall
die with it!
I am off ...
Uh oh.
The place is falling apart!
Meanwhile ...
... in Blackcrag Fortress ...
Have they succeeded?
One moment ...
They have!
Then get them out of there!           
I will try ...
Nice knowing you all.
Hurry!
I have them!
Welcome, %-12.12s        
What happened?
Your task is done.
Valorim is saved.   
Why are we here?
We have been watching you,           
hoping to help when        
your task was done.        
So we have come full circle.           
I have found out you are Anama.           
The people of Exile,        
I assure you we will think           
who we abused so severely,             
upon your faith more kindly           
have come back to save us.        
in the future.  
It was no problem.
It is time for rewards.        
One more must join us now.           
Bring Anaximander here.        
As you command.
Greetings, Anaximander.    
Greetings, your majesty.         
They completed their task.           
So I have heard.    
I am of my word, and will             
meet my end of our bargain.            
She pulls out a scroll.          
This document entitles the           
people of Exile to the lands           
of southeastern Valorim.          
They are rich and nearly                 
empty. There, the people of                 
Exile may have the peace and               
future they have earned.               
Anaximander takes the scroll. 
The people of Exile    
Thank your majesty    
for her kindness.   
Prazac turns to you. 
And now your reward.     
Of course, you will be given            
many thousands of gold pieces.               
In addition ...      
Prazac touches you on the shoulder. 
I bestow upon you the highest    
honor the Empire can bestow.    
I declare all of you    
to be Dervishes of the Empire.    
Hmmph.
Prazac returns to her throne. 
Suddenly ... 
The shade of Rentar-Ihrno appears,
projected from far below the surface.
Her head is bowed in defeat.
Why are you here?     
Come to cause more death?        
We have lost.
            You have defeated us.
But.
                Our memories are eternal.
                        Our vengeance will still be had.
               One day, your children
                 will pay for your crimes,
           by the multitudes.
      Never forget.
                  Every moment of every day,
                     the souls cry for vengeance.
      Never forget.
We will not forget.      
We almost got her.
It does not matter.      
More blood will not help.             
We will pay for our crimes            
for many years to come.      
But enough of that!      
It is the time to celebrate!               
A crowd of people is waiting    
outside, dying to see the          
saviors of Valorim.     
Let us go.   
You walk outside,
into the bright sun,
To bask in the cheers 
of the Empire's people.
After decades of struggle,
The people of Exile
will know peace at last.

'H'Exile (verb) -
To banish or expel ...
from one's native land.
Exile is also a place -
many miles of caves and tunnels,
far below the world's surface.
The Empire rules the surface totally.
When they discovered Exile,
they had the perfect use for it:
a prison.
Everyone who didn't fit in:
the rebels,
the antisocial,
the disliked.
They were teleported to Exile ...
forever.
The Exiles were not inactive.
They built subterranean cities.
They learned to fight.
They studied magic.
They built their strength,
and when they were ready ...
they got their revenge.
The archmage Erika 
made her own teleporter. 
Emperor Hawthorne ruled the Empire. 
He was brilliant ... 
... and ruthless ... 
and hated totally.
WHAT?
Oh Hell.
Takos?
Yes?
It is time to deal with Exile.
Yes, Garzahd.
Exile struck down the Emperor.
Four years later ...
... the Empire invaded.
Exile was outgunned ....
... and outnumbered.
The Empire War was thought lost ...
... until Exile found an ally.
The alien Vahnatai joined you ...
... and turned the tide.
The Empire was expelled.
Exile won the Empire war.
Five years passed.
Nothing was heard from the Empire.
The Exiles decided ...
... that it was time to return ...
... to the surface.
They built a teleporter ...
... and formed Upper Exile ...
... a new series of caves ...
... just below the surface.
They then selected someone ...
... to explore the surface ...
... for the first time:
You.
Your testing was extensive ...
... and very painful.
Your briefing was considerable ...
This ...
... is a TREE!
What's it for?
... and confusing.
You were sent up to Fort Emergence   
in Upper Exile. You are to go see  
someone named Anaximander to get your   
orders, and then go up to the surface.    
All Exile waits on you.
All wait to see what you'll find.  
They want to return to the surface.    
You carry the dreams of your people.  
Good luck.

At long last, victory is yours. The plague of monsters has been ended, and the Exiles can one again see the light of the sun. The bizarre and tormented odyssey of the people of Exile may finally be drawing to a close.
But surely not everything has been done! What of the plight of the people of Marish? The five artifact quests? The many small dungeons out in the wilderness? Perhaps your adventuring days are not yet done.
But then, perhaps they are. If so, thank you very much for playing Exile III: Ruined World, and I hope you try Spiderweb Software's next production. Until then, happy hunting!

For some reason, the game was unable to open the files 'Exile III Towns' or 'Exile III Outdoors'. Quit Exile III, make sure these files are in the Exile III folder and run it again, and it should work. If not, contact Spiderweb Software.

Welcome to the wonderful world of Exile III! Exile III is truly an epic, with an intricate plot, a world that changes as events progress, and an amazing variety of paths your characters can take.
Exile III, like most games of its type, is fairly complicated. Fortunately, there are plenty of places to look for help should you get confused. Be sure to read the online documentation (hit F1 to see it).
This file contains not only complete instructions for playing and ordering the game, but a quick guide to getting started and a mini-hint book for the first few quests.
Also be sure to look at the Preferences Window (in the File menu). It can make the game move faster (very useful for older machines), slower, and even easier, change the display, and remove the special effects.
Rest assured, if you get stuck, there's plenty of stuff available to help you out. So on with the game, have fun, and watch your back!
Finally, alas, the Windows world nowadays is rife with outdated drivers and other problems. If you experience crashes playing Exile III, there is troubleshooting info in the file _README.TXT_.
WELCOME TO EXILE III: RUINED WORLD!

Alas, the cruel forces that are ravaging your world have claimed a new set of victims. 
Anaximander greets the news of your demise with sadness, and then starts the search for a new group of adventurers. The plagues of monsters must be ended, if the Exiles are ever to return to the surface. Care to take another shot?

Unfortunately, this game requires 8-bit Color Quickdraw to run optimally. It might work with less, or it might not work at all. Do you wish to try?
Exit Exile
Play as is
This game is best with 256 Color Quickdraw, which you have on your system. It plays acceptably well with 16 colors. With more colors, the graphics sometimes turn to static, and the game will be unstable. 
Would you like your monitor set to 256 colors?

There are a wide variety of magical walls and barriers which you can create and will encounter...
EXILE HELP: MAGIC BARRIERS
Wall of Fire - The weakest wall. Short lived and low damage. | |Wall of Force - Does more damage than a Wall of Fire and lasts a bit longer.
Stinking Cloud - Lasts a short time, and curses anyone who enters.
Web - Lasts until walked through. Slows down the victim, and interfers with attacks. Pause to clean off webs. | |Antimagic Field - Spells cannot be casts while in this, nor may they be targeted into it. It fades eventually.
Wall of Ice - Does as much damage as a Wall of Force, but lasts much longer. | |Wall of Blades - Long lasting, and does the most damage of the wall spells.
Fire Barrier - Permanent. Only removable by Dispel Barrier spell. Damages anyone who walks into it. Blocks quickfire. |Force Barrier - Like Fire Barrier, but cannot be moved through.
Quickfire - The most deadly of the barriers, once created it spreads through the dungeon/town destroying everything. It can only be blocked by the two barrier spells. Antimagic fields slow it down.

There are two sorts of magic spells: mage spells and priest spells. There are 62 spells of each type, each with a level from one to seven.
EXILE HELP: MAGIC
You can only cast mage (or priest) spells of a level as high as your Mage (or Priest) Spells skill. There are two ways to cast a spell:
Mage spells cannot be cast by someone wearing bulky armor (although armor can be put on after you're through casting spells). |WARNING: Spells cast by a PC with 1, 2 or 3 intelligence will be very weak!
You start automatically knowing most spells up to level 3. Other spells you have to track down. Some are known by sages who can teach them to you (for a price). Others must be found in dungeons and ruins.
When you decide to cast a spell, you will be a given a list of spells with green lights next to the spells you are currently able to cast (and not those that you are, say, too low a level to cast).
Note that spell effects are cumulative. Two poison spells do more than twice the damage of one poison spell. If a fear spell doesn't work, the next one will be more likely to. Casting 3 bless spells on a PC will make him/her a powerhouse.
SPELL MENUS - The Cast Mage and Cast Priest menus are automatically updated to contain the spells the active PC can cast. To have a PC cast a spell, click on that PC's name to the upper right, and select the spell to cast from these menus.
SPELL CASTING WINDOW - Press the mage or priest spell button to the lower left (or type 'm' or 'p'). Press the number of the character to cast, the button by the spell, and then the target button by the PC to cast the spell on (if needed).
To get anywhere in Exile, you will need to talk at great length to the people around you. To talk to someone, click on the mouth button and then on the person to talk to.
EXILE HELP: TALKING AND SHOPS
In the talk window, type the thing to ask about (always a single word) and hit enter. Everyone responds to:|     'look'    'name'    'job'|Saying 'bye' ends the conversation. 
Talking to people is how you buy things, such as food or training. Usually, just saying 'buy' works. Sometimes, however, you have to say the specific thing they sell: if Albert says _I identify things._ ask about 'identify.'
Some people may provide valuable hints about what others know about. For example, if someone says _You should ask Tor about supplies,_ when you meet Tor 'supplies' should be one of the first things you ask about.
You can figure out other things to ask the people about by picking words out of what they say. If JimBob says _I love killing Nephilim,_ 'killing' and 'Nephilim' are likely bets.
Due to finite memory, people will generally not have more to say about everything they talk about, just the important things.
1_63
5_724
During your adventures, you will come across mind-boggling quantities of stuff. To pick up some of it, move your party (or active PC) near it, and hit the get button (or 'g'). Then, on the Get Item window, click on the item to grab.
EXILE III HELP: ITEM INFO SCREEN
Once there, to equip (i.e. use) or unequip (take off) an item, click on its name. Other buttons will appear enabling you do to other things:
Items from slain monsters normally appear unidentified. To identify them, take them to a sage (such as Habecker in Fort Emergence). Also, buying Item Lore skill sometimes makes monster's treasure appear already identified.
Once obtained, items show up in this window. Type '1'-'6' or click on the numbered button to bring up a character's inventory. 
5_1100
The Sell, ID, and Enchant buttons only appear when talking to a person who can do these things. Many shopkeepers will buy your items, and certain sages can identify and even enchant them.
Finally, hitting the Jobs button (or typing '8') takes you to the jobs page, where you can see what jobs you currently have. Hitting the 'Spec' button (or typing '9') brings up whatever special items you have.
0_78
5_723
Starting over will delete the current party. Are you sure you want to do this?
While playing Exile, you will meet many, many beings who want to kill you, both outdoors and in dungeons. When you are attacked outdoors, a battlefield will appear. When attacked in town, press the sword button to start combat. 
EXILE HELP: COMBAT
During combat, each of your characters go, one after another, then the monsters act. Move into a monster to attack it. If you press the 'Active' button, only the currently active PC will act until you press it again.
When monsters hit you, you are damaged and lose health points. When a blow would take you below 0 health, you end up at 0 health. If you take damage when at 0 health, you die. If you take a lot of damage while at 0 health, you turn to dust.
When you use poison during combat, you poison your melee weapon or arrows (thrown weapons cannot be poisoned). The next several monsters you hit will take a lot of extra damage over time. 
There are five sorts of weapons: edged, bashing, and pole, which are hand-to-hand weapons, and bow and thrown missile, which are missile weapons. You can buy skill in each of the five weapon types, which makes them hit more often.
Equipping armor makes monster's blows do less damage. However, heavy armor makes you less likely to hit. Don't wear heavy armor if your weapon skill is low. You can equip two weapons, but this makes you MUCH less likely to hit.

Suddenly, the Shareware Demon appears! It says _Ahem. Alas, you may not enter this area until the game has been registered._ He shrugs apologetically.
_To find out how to perform this blessed act, click on 'Shareware Info' on the title screen._ It waves and disappears in a puff of sulphurous smoke.
SCROLLING THE SCREEN - When looking in town or combat, clicking the gray border of the view screen shifts the view around. Similarly, you can target people offscreen in combat by clicking on the terrain border.
EXILE HELP: VALUABLE INFO
For every (about) 100 experience a character gets, he/she gains a level. With each level comes more health and skill points. The latter may be traded at a trainer for better skills. 
EXPERIENCE - When you kill a monster, the character striking the death blow gets a bunch of experience, and everyone else gets a lesser amount. When a monster dies of poison, everyone splits the experience.
STORING ITEMS - Should you get too many items to carry, there are 3 places in the game where they can be stored. You only have to find them.
SAVING MAPS - Your maps are saved in your save files. To stop doing this (and make the save files much smaller) you can turn off Saved Maps on the Preferences screen.|HELPFUL HINTS - Many useful tips are available under the 'Library' menu.
SEARCHING - To search a barrel, crate, desk, etc. or open a chest, stand adjacent and look at it.
HEALTH WARNING - When a blow knocks you down to 0 health, you are warned by a coughing noise.

You pass through the door, and find yourself in a small, dimly lit office. It is filled with stacks of papers, maps, plans, scraps covered with notes, and the like. It also contains many plates and mugs, all in need of washing.
In addition to all the other clutter, you find a small, ratty man, clothes and hair in disarray, twitching with nervous energy. When you enter, he leaps up and rushes over to greet you.
_Greetings, my friends! I am so glad you're finally here. I am Anaximander. As Commander Johnson commands the military half of the fort, I run the somewhat ... ummm ... more covert operations._ He speaks very, very fast.
_I will be the person you report to and get further instructions from during your explorations of the surface world. When you do something, come to me. When you don't do something, come to me. When you're just plain confused, come to me._
He leaps back over to his seat and sorts through papers, looking for something. He can't find it. _Damnation! I have somewhere a map of a nearby goblin outpost. There's a bandit lair, too, in the caves._|
_We thought you might want to go there to learn to work as a team and pick up some loot before exploring the surface. There's a map to there around here somewhere. Search a bit._
_Then, when you're warmed up and ready to explore the surface, come back here! I'll have more instructions._ He nods, flashes you a disturbingly broad grin, and goes back to his notes.

Berra looks at the crystal shards you found in the golem factory. After a few minutes, he gets a peculiar look on his face. He takes them and says _Wait. Let me test these._
He is gone for several hours. You go to the dining hall, return, and find Berra waiting for you, looking visibly upset. He says _After the Empire War, we found some Empire records on tests they did on Crystal Souls._
_Crystal Souls are the souls of the Vahnatai ancestors in crystal form, and exist to defend and advise the Vahnatai people. The Empire managed to find out a lot about the qualities and make-up of these beings._
He takes a deep breath. _What you have here are the fragments of a Crystal Soul, no doubt about it. The golems were being created by a Vahnatai spirit._
_I tell you now, as sure as I am standing here, that the monsters on the surface are being created by Vahnatai. I think you should go tell Anaximander of this. We are all in terrible, terrible trouble._

From below the Earth, you are suddenly bombarded with images, send to you mentally by the now triumphant Grah-Hoth. A portal has been opened, and hordes of demons are flowing into Exile. The portal to the surface has been destroyed.
You cannot go help. Nothing can be done. By the time Exile can fight of the invasion, there will be very little left. Maybe, someday, the few survivors will return to the surface. It will, however, be hard to take much satisfaction in it.

After years in subterranean hovels, the splendors of the huge buildings and streets before you, teeming with life, makes your eyes pop. You enter the city of Krizsan for the first time.
After worrying about how you will be greeted by the Empire's citizens when you actually enter one of their cities, you find your fears were ill-founded. Nobody gives you more than a passing look as they go about their business.
However, all is clearly not well. The people are nervous, and watch the ground carefully as they walk. As you look closer, you see the city walls have been scorched and melted. A sour smell you cannot identify hangs over the street.
It occurs to you that these people may not care about being visited by Exiles, because they have much more pressing concerns to deal with...

You stand in the middle of a shipyard in ruins. The pattern of the wreckage tells the story quite clearly. Large holes have been melted in the city wall, probably with acid, enabling the slimes to slip through.
After that, the scorched walls indicate heavy spell use, causing fires. More acid completed the destruction. Finally, the holes were plugged with magical barriers, and the building was left abandoned. A sour smell hangs over the ruins.
One thing is clear - individually, the slimes may not be that powerful. In groups, however, they can wreak a remarkable amount of damage.

When the slimes invaded this inn, one poor soul got trapped in here. There's not much left of the body. It's mostly been dissolved.

You stride into the city of Shayder, relieved that nobody seems inclined to attack you at the moment.It's a beautiful city, all clean buildings, elegant architecture, and carefully tended lawns and gardens.
Something, however, is not right. The city is too still. There are few people in the streets, and they avoid each other. Everyone takes great pains to not get too close to anyone else. Everything is way too quiet for such a large city.
Strangest of all, however, is the smell. It's the smell of rotting flesh, smoke, and a host of other unnerving elements, which seem to stick to your clothes, your hair, and the inside of your nose.
You have reached the city of Shayder, and it is clear that all is not well with the world.

Ahonar grins when you bring up the subject. _I have spoken to several Anama priests on the subject,_ he says, _and you do indeed seem like excellent Anama material. We would be pleased to welcome you into our church._
_To do so, of course, you would need to renounce your magical spells. However, this will not be near the setback you imagine, for that knowledge will be replaced by a much greater knowledge of holy arts._
_We will allow you into our inner sanctum, where you may peruse our prayer books, and obtain many spells as yet unknown to you. In addition, there are devices available to replace the most useful mage spells._
_This is the opportunity that is open to you. Lose a little power in a dangerous art, for much more power in a holy one. So I ask you, brave adventurers, will you join us?_
(Joining the Anama takes away the ability to cast Mage spells, but gives much more powerful priest skills and other benefits. You can win the game whether or not you join the Anama.)
1_63
5_422
The ceremony is short, elegant, and performed on the spot. You get on your knees before Ahonar, and take an oath never again to cast or train in Mage Spells. Ahonar promises, in turn, that the Anama will look after you and aid you always.
As the words pour from your mouths, the knowledge of Mage Spells flows out of your head, replaced by a greater knowledge of the holy arts. Extra energy bubbles up inside you.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, Ahonar places the Anama rings on your fingers. You check - they refuse to come off. He raises you to your feet, and hugs each one of you. He looks genuinely thrilled.
And with that, the ceremony is done. You are now full members of the Anama church.

You immediately start to feel ill. Your head spins. Things rearrange themselves in your minds. You become disoriented. Your head hurts. You forget where you are, and what you're doing. You faint.
You wake up quickly, and look around. Your Anama rings are gone. You've forgotten most of the priest spells you knew. Much of the energy you gained when you joined the Anama is gone.
You feel a great wave of sadness. For a short time, here on the surface, there was a place where you belonged. No more. You have been expelled from the Anama.

You walk into Sharimik, and find it to be a very grim place. People walk quietly from place to place, being careful to look no one in the eye. Massive guards watch the townspeople carefully as they pass.
Signs of troglodyte attacks are everywhere. The walls are crumbling under the constant barrage of fireballs and shockwave spells.
When you enter, a group of guards immediately surround you and look you over. They seem prepared to throw you out, if not attack you outright.
As they prepare to assault you, a lieutenant runs up and whispers to them. Whatever was said, it was in your favor. Grumbling, they slouch away. One of them mumbles _Welcome to Sharimik._
The townspeople give you quick furtive glances as they pass, and then quickly move on. Welcome to Sharimik, clearly a grim, icy place indeed.

You stride boldly into Sharimik, and are immediately struck by how cold and grim a place it is. The walls are crumbling under troglodyte assaults, and the people move quickly by, being careful not to look anyone in the eye.
As soon as the guards see you've walked in, however, people's attitudes go from cold to downright hostile. A soldier shouts _Them! They're the Exiles! Get them!_
More troops appear. Weapons are drawn. You quickly leave, before the paranoid people of Sharimik filet you.

Suddenly, a shockwave hits, almost knocking you off your feet! It leaves you undamaged, but has put a large crack in the west wall of the chamber.

You enter Lorelei, a city under constant bombardment. The streets are littered with fragments of stones hill giants have lobbed over the walls, and every building shows the signs of the impacts.
Lorelei's narrow, cobblestoned streets are nearly empty. Everyone stays inside as much as possible, to stay safe from the bombardment.
Unfortunately, you don't get to see much of town. Shortly after you enter, a platoon of guards marches up to you, led by an Empire Dervish.
The Dervish lifts the visor on her helmet and says _I'm Commander Bruskrud of the Lorelei militia. I'm afraid we can't let you in here. If you'd done something to show you could be trusted, it'd be all right. We could allow it._
She shakes her head. _Unfortunately, you're a bit of a security risk. Loose cannons. I'm sure you understand._ Then, before you get a chance to respond, she marches off, leaving the guards to push you back out.

You walk out onto the streets of Gale for the first time. It's the most unpleasant city you've seen in Valorim so far. A thick smoky haze hangs over the streets, and the roads and buildings have been scarred by fireball bombardments.
As is usual for Valorim, alert guards are everywhere. However, they seem more interested in watching the townspeople than anything else. The people are quiet and nervous, cowed by the guards around them.
Many of the people have glazed expressions on their faces. They stumble down the street, seemingly unsure of where they are or where they're going. The air smells of decay, of sulphur, and of something you don't recognize.

After many battles and obstacles, you have finally reached one of your goals: one of the pools where the slimes that have infested the area are created.
Even now, lumps are shifting and growing under its surface, soon to become vicious, mindless creatures ready to slay the innocents of Krizsan Province. The whole process is horrifying in its simplicity and automation.
However, the battle is still not over. You've reached one of the inner caverns of the fortress, and the slime maker is at your mercy? Now what?
1_63

At long last, you reach the innermost source of the infection. It is a huge cavern, its walls scratched by the flailing of huge tentacles, the floor covered with tiny droplets of gray goo, moving under its own power.

5_2534
You don't notice many of the details, however. You're too busy looking at the master of the caves. It towers over you, keening in fury over the loss of its gelatinous children.
It is a beast that seems truly alien to this world. It is twenty feet high, a writhing mass of tentacles, fibrous jelly, and eyestalks. A croaking roar, unlike any noise you've ever heard, comes from deep within.
Spitting goo, muscular tentacles lashing, the master of the slimes lunges forward to have its revenge on you.
1_63
5_708
All the evidence in these caves points to one thing: the slimes didn't just migrate here by chance. They were placed here, by something powerful and intelligent.
Carved into the cave wall here is what would seem to be the final evidence of that. It's a mage's rune, a mark of ownership or creation, often placed by a wizard on a particularly good piece of work.
You don't recognize the mark, but surely someone at Fort Emergence will. You memorize it.

With a roar that seems to shake the entire cavern, the Alien Slime shakes and collapses. Almost immediately, it begins to decay, its body parts falling apart and decomposing into goo.
The creature's death howl is echoed by other, smaller screams, reverberating through the tunnels. As their master goes, the slimes nearby are following. Hopefully, most, if not all, of the slimes elsewhere are dying too.
You stand, bloodied and battered, alone in the cavern. You have little doubt that Krizsan is now free of the slime menace. A great victory is yours.
Yet, the victory is unsatisfying. Somebody powerful must have created this place. There's too much magic about to think otherwise. The question is: who?
This threat has been removed. However, if the creator, the source of the problem, is not discovered, the surface, your home, may yet be destroyed.

Your magical flame blows the slime pool into hundreds of tiny globules, which twitch slightly, try to reform, and die. There is one less slime factory in existence.

With the elegant arcing of a fireball, the last slime pool is destroyed. As you survey the smoking wreckage, you hear a horrendous roar. It shakes the stone of the cavern, and makes some smaller stalactites fall.

You are close enough to the portal to get a close look, and it's truly a sight to chill the soul. The portal looks like the insubstantial form of Linda the arch-mage, but massively, painfully stretched.
Her spirit is stretched paper thin by an invisible force. Her ghost from the waist down is below the floor, and the entrance to the portal is through her stomach. Her face is hideously distended, and twisted in pain.
When you approach, she looks down at you, and speaks. _Help me! You must release me! Enter me, and I will be disrupted, and I can send you home. Help me! I cannot hold Grah-Hoth off for long!_
What do you do?

As you pull out the tiny blessed knife, Linda's spirit looks at you in horror. _What are you doing? No, don't!_ You pass the knife through her, and it slices her thin form smoothly.
You hear two piercing screams, one from Linda's tormented soul, and one from the actual Linda, as her tormented existence ends. The anguished sounds are joined by furious roars, as the demons are, one by one, sucked back to the netherworld.
You start to feel satisfied at your victory, but then you hear Grah-Hoth's voice, coming from the rapidly fading Linda/portal. _No, mortal! You may have held me back, but you will not escape without paying the price!_
A searing wind rises, and impacts begin to shake the Tower of Magi. You try to run, but the quakes knock you to the ground. Just as the ceiling begins to cave in, just when you're sure you're done for, there is a flash of light ...
You're back in Upper Exile, in the Portal Fortress. Seles stands over you looking relieved. _Well done,_ she says. _That was very close._

THE PLACE OF VALORIM, by Nell of the Isle of Bigail.
The continent of Valorim is the most unusual and wild of the lands controlled by the Empire, and many questions remain about its future. It was only recently settled, after all, and the frontier spirit remains.
The people of Valorim have little in common with its Empire cousins. We have not been as controlled by the Empire bureaucracy, and do not share many of its prejudices, such as the hatred of Nephilim and Exiles.
As more people flood into our land, and we become more similar to the more settled, controlled other Empire continents, the question is: how will the wilder spirits of Valorim deal with the inevitable crushing control the Empire brings?
One thing is for sure. Before long, we will look more and more to Blackcrag Fortress, the massive Empire stronghold at the north end of Valorim. But will they look down on us with understanding, or not?

At first, the writing on the pages of this book is alien to you. As you look, however, the words reform on the page, enabling you to read them!
The book is similar to a manual. It describes how the Filth Factory works, in broad terms. Basically, it manufactures high energy trash and dumps it below, where the roaches can eat it.
The garbage created is actually decomposing plant matter, grown in three subterranean, artificial swamps on this level. Pipes suck up the plants, and carry them to the refining room.
There, the plants are mixed with diseased goo sucked up from where the roaches grow. This infects it, giving it the noxious quality that makes the roaches that eat it carriers of all sorts of vicious ailments.
Finally, pipes carry it to silos, and from there through a huge trench down into the roach pit. It is eaten by the evil creatures, who then go out to cause carnage.
It's an incredibly complex and carefully thought out operation. It was created by someone with both power and genius. The machinery is described as having major shielding and magical protection. It will be very difficult to destroy.

5_228
You stand at the entrance to the concentric walls of trash and scum which are the origin of most of the roaches on this island. The hissing coming from within is almost deafening.
The walls of trash, mostly rotting vegetation from the artificial swamps above, are dotted with thousands of small roaches, many as large as the palm of your hand. They scavenge the walls, growing and preparing to leave the Factory.
This is the core of the Factory, the true factory floor. If the roaches are to be stopped, this is the place that must be destroyed. Maybe you can find a good way to do it within ...
1_63
5_228
You stare out at the exact center of the roach pit, where the new, freshly processed slime bubbles to the surface. You stare out over the lake in disgust, trying to figure out a way to sabotage it.
Among the many other unpleasant aromas that assail your nose, you can detect hints of methane. If you had a way to create a huge fire, you might be able to burn the place to the ground. Alas, creating such a flame is beyond your skills.
Maybe if you left the Filth Factory and looked around, you could find something which could help you destroy this place. It's not something you're capable of now.

5_228
At last, you reach the core of the roach pit. Here, the freshest, most potent of the decomposing swamp mulch oozes to the surface and spreads through the trash walls. You smell a strong hint of methane in the air.
If the Phoenix Egg were used here and operates as promised, its flames may well be enough to burn down the roach pit, and maybe the whole place as well. Use it?

You hurl the Phoenix Egg into the slime. At first, nothing happens. You start to get nervous - you're afraid you wasted the thing, and your mission is doomed.
Then, as you're about to give up hope and turn back, a column of flame erupts from the pool of filth! The flames race along the trash walls, even managing to ignite the damp, decomposed roots and moss.
The hisses of panicked, dying roaches rise from the havoc. The searing fires start to grow, and move towards you. It's definitely time to leave ...

Filthy and covered with ash, you turn away from the ruin. Without constant reinforcements, the roaches days on the Isle of Bigail are numbered. Your mission here is finished.

THE STORY OF THE TROGLODYTES
We know not where we came from. One day we were not. The next day, we were. We know we were once a mighty people. Then we were not. Now again we are. But the generations between are gone. We have ancestors, but no fathers or mothers.
They who brought us back again are called by us the Glowing Ones. They brought us to get our vengeance on the humans who took us from the world. This was good to us! Great, we said, would be the flow of blood that we would bring forth!
But then, curse the Glowing Ones, they brought back the giants to fight with us as well! The giants, the great enemy! We remember little, but we remember that! The Ones connected our castle to that of the giants by a tunnel. What a gift!
We charged through the tunnel, and they charged back. The Glowing Ones, curse them, were angered! We must fight humans, they said! So they closed the tunnel with the Great Barrier, and the giants were far from us.
But our foes exist, and we will feed on them yet. One day the barrier will come down, and our war may be resumed. Until then, humans will be our meat. But we live by the Great Dream.

5_708
Humans -
I have told you the offer. Refuse it, and humans die still. Slay Khazi Elhioc, and we may yet be able to fight the giants, the great enemy.
You may not come back to speak with me. If Khazi Elhioc suspects I consort with humans, I will be slain, and the war against humans will be our true and only focus. You must decide.
If you refuse, leave through a secret passage to the south. Rest assured, I will remember your cowardice.
But if you are warriors, and relish a challenge, there is a secret door in your cell to the lower caves. Go. The shamans are to the southwest. Avoid them. They are mighty, and will overwhelm you.
Go instead north to the Halls of Concordance, and from there west. Elhioc lives in a cell guarded by a strange gate we cannot fathom. This you must open.
When he is dead, return to the stairway you came down, and leave quietly out the south passage. You will be rewarded.
Good luck to you. One day I will feed on you and yours, but not until the Great Enemy is gone.
- Vothkaro, High King of the Troglodyte People

You reach the top of the stairs, exhausted but triumphant. A small troglodyte is there to greet you. He recites a short, simple message.
_I bring you the appreciation of King Vothkaro of the troglodytes. He applauds your unexpected triumph. He also expresses interest in the opening of the Great Barrier, an act of mutual benefit to us and the humans._
_To that end, he mentions that the Great Barrier is created by a magical artifact on the other side, and that Vothkaro believes that a passage to it exists. This passage was mapped before the cursed Glowing Ones created the barriers._
_At this point, we do not know where the passage to the artifact is, because the map was stolen by giants. It is written on a piece of drakeskin. It probably rests in the giant's castle, to the north, over the mountains._
_I bid you luck, and hope you can destroy the barriers. For now, I will consolidate power and slay more humans. Good luck to you. You may leave to the south._
The troglodyte adds on his own _Also, Vothkaro would like this taken to the mayor of Sharimik._ He hands you a scroll. His job done, the troglodyte moves off quickly.

You look ahead, and gape in horror. The sight in front of you makes everything you've seen so far seem paltry in comparison. This is the golem tower's factory floor.
It's one huge room, its ceiling eighty feet above your head, at least. It is partitioned into sections by massive walls and pieces of pulsing, glowing, magical machinery.
The room is full of acrid smells and grinding, humming sounds. You know all too well what is happening inside - the creation of the golems. Deep in the guts of these infernal machines, the horrors are being made by the thousands.
Looking down, you see something else that's very unsettling. The floors are moving. Many of the sections of the floor are formed of flat pieces of metal, held together by flexible leather straps.
Driven by some sort of magic you've never experienced, these floors are shifting. They must be there to move golems from the machines to the entrance, where they can go out and cause havoc.
It's hard to imagine how any small group could even hope to affect such a  massive, horrid edifice. However, assault it you must, if this province is to be saved.

With a cloud of smoke and a convulsive shudder, the golem machine ceases operation. It's very satisfying, but you can already hear from inside the sounds of repairs taking place.
Whatever you do to destroy this place,  you're going to have to strike somewhere farther up.

The top of this magical pedestal is a shimmering mosaic of designs, schematics, accounts of troop numbers and movements, and other information. This must be where all the information about the golems and the war is displayed!
Unfortunately, you can't control the display in any way. However, by watching it carefully, you can make some sense of it.
The information seems to be focused around the town of Tevrono - estimations of troops inside, inventories of golems nearby, possible attack routes on the town, and golems casualty lists. The golems have lost many of their number there.
In fact, the impression you get from the display is of a sort of stalemate. None of the golem's attack routes can proceed until the machine sees Tevrono as secured. Tevrono is single-handedly stalling the golem advance.
However, the machine is also confident that Tevrono doesn't have enough forces to be a threat to the golem tower. It's probably right. Thus, the two sides are in stalemate.
A stalemate, it would appear, that only you can break.

Nerves on edge, unsure what to expect, you walk into the massive maw of Blackcrag Fortress. The passage is enormous, magically assembled by enormous blocks of polished black stone.
As you walk in, you suddenly hear a booming voice. It must be one of the guard's voices, magically augmented. He says:
_Attention, visitors! As you must be aware, Valorim has been declared under quarantine by the infinitely powerful and wise Empress Prazac, until such time as a way of dealing with the monster plague has been devised._
_Until such a time, this fortress is off limits to you. Depart immediately, or suffer the most grievous of punishments._
The portculli at the end of the passage are closed, and look like they'll remain so. It looks like this way in isn't going to work out for you.

You enter the Keep of Tinraya. Once Valorim's most well defended, wealthiest, mightiest city, it's now just another pathetic ruin, devastated by the fury of the alien beasts.
Most of the buildings are, surprisingly, still standing. They were probably left that way to serve as dens for the beasts. You can hear them, dozens of them, if not hundreds, all throughout the city.
You do see one thing of great interest. The west side of town is dominated by a massive black structure. It's round, smooth stone, which looks more like it was grown than built.
Whatever it is, you strongly doubt it was built by the humans who lived here.

With a final blow, the Crystal Soul shatters into a million pieces. The spirit within disappears, howling pitifully as it goes. The other Souls cry out in grief.

When you shatter the third Crystal Soul, the shade of Rentar-Ihrno reappears. Her alien face is twisted in grief and hatred, borne with an intensity staggering to comprehend.
With a single motion of her hand, the last Crystal Soul disappears. She says _You filth. You less than living things. You have slain Jekknol-Bok. And Lorta-Bok. And Vyvnas-Bok. For this, you, and all your kind, will pay! You will rot!_
There is an explosion, a flash of light, and a deep rumble. Then all is quiet. You are alone in the chamber.

At the west end of this chamber are four Crystal Souls, each surrounded by a halo of sparkling energy. Flashes of light travel into and out of them, as they send commands to the monsters that are ravaging your home.
You can just hear their dark commands in the corners of your mind. As you struggle to listen, you see an apparition float up above them. It's a projection of Rentar-Ihrno, the master mage of the Vahnatai.
Her voice is sharp and cruel as she speaks. _So, humans, you have found us at last. We seek our rightful revenge against this Empire, and yet, despite the rightness of our claim, you continue to oppose us._
_They took our Crystal Souls from us,  and tormented them endlessly! For this, they must pay, no matter what! By aiding them, you join in their wickedness. Now you shall pay!_

You return to the hall, to find the projection of Rentar-Ihrno conferring with the Crystal Souls. One of the Souls makes a chirping noise, and she turns, surprised to see you.
_What!_ she yells. _What are you doing out?_ She looks over at the magical teleporter trap by the other door, and realizes you're far from it. For a moment, she actually seems at a loss for what to do.
Then, one of the Crystal Souls broadcasts a message to everyone in the room. _I, Jekknol-Bok, say that we have had enough of these interlopers. We will destroy them, now._ The other Crystal Souls chime their assent.
As the Crystal Souls begin to glow, summoning up the energy to vaporize you, you realize that perhaps now would be the best time to use the weapon you got in the Bunker. You pull it out, activate it, and wait nervously.
The energy glow surrounding the Crystal Souls wavers, as the Souls struggle to remain active. The battle is futile ... the power fades, and disappears. The mighty, ancient beings sleep.
Rentar-Ihrno looks at you and the magical device in horror. She casts a spell, and she and the inert Souls disappear. As she fades, she says simply _There will be a mighty reckoning one day, humans._
A handful of dispirited Vahnatai guards remain. They attack.

You pass through the gate, and stare out into the cavernous halls of Rentar-Ihrno's fortress. All around you you hear the alarmed shouts of guards, rushing to do battle with you.
The granite of the fortress walls, ceiling and floor are all of one uniform piece, as if this place was not built, but stretched and molded from the living rock of the cavern. The air crackles with power.
To the east, through another set of gates, you can see the central hall of the fortress. Many Vahnatai move back and forth in there, shouting and casting spells.

You stare out into the central hall of Rentar-Ihrno's fortress. This is clearly the center of the magical operations that go on here. The energy emanating from this room makes your skin feel sunburned.
The chamber is dominated by an enormous pit, almost eighty feet across. It's not there for decorative effect - you can see its sides are covered with a slimy residue, as if huge alchemical reactions were carried out inside it.
On the other side of the pit, you see Rentar-Ihrno, leader and archmage of the Vahnatai, standing by a small pedestal. She stands tall and proud, wreathed in a glowing cloak of protective spells.
She lifts up something round. You soon realize what it is - the head of a Vahnatai. She calls out to you, _I have here the head of your hidden benefactor, discovered at last. This was Bon-Ihrno, bringer of 'peace' between our peoples._
_You protect those who stole our Crystal Souls, our honored ancestors, from us. He protected you. You are all traitors, and all must die, so our sacred vengeance may be attained!_
That was all she had to say. She stands there, shrouded in her protective spells, waiting for you to fight her.

Rentar-Ihrno watches you nervously as you approach, keeping a watchful eye on the pit in the middle of the chamber. The powerful goo you have channeled churns and sparks below you, waiting to be released.

Suddenly, with impeccable timing, the amulets Erika gave you begin to heat up and glow brightly. You wince in pain, worried that they're are about to sear your flesh. Then, they emit one final flash of blinding light and crumble into dust!
At first, you're disappointed, thinking that the archmage Erika's powerful magic has failed her at last. Then you look up, and realize that exactly the opposite has happened. Erika is now standing on the dais next to Rentar-Ihrno!
Erika looks at Rentar-Ihrno with fury and contempt. _You dare to trifle with Exile?_ she says. _You dare to threaten my home? Now, Vahnatai, you will find out how a real mage fights!_
Rentar-Ihrno responds instantly, not with words, but with a searing bolt of flame. Erika parries it easily, and the two mightiest mages on the planet immediately join in a battle of wizardry unlike any you've ever seen. 
As they trade mighty spells and counter spells, Rentar-Ihrno's pedestal sits unguarded.

As you reach the pedestal, the battle between Erika and Rentar-Ihrno is reaching a crescendo, and Erika seems to be winning. Rentar's defenses are weakening, and Erika's spells are still as potent as they were when the duel started.
However, Rentar-Ihrno was prepared, and she still has one trick remaining. She flings one last magical bolt, but not at Erika. She launches it towards the ceiling.
As it punches a hole through the roof, there is a deafening rumble from above. A crevasse appears in the mountain over you. A narrow deep crevasse, leading from the surface down to the Vahnatai's enormous cavern.
A single, pencil thin shaft of light comes through the crevasse, and then through the hole in the roof, to strike Erika in the small of the back. When it hits, Erika instantly becomes a torch. It happens far too quickly to react. 
She doesn't even have time to scream. In moments, she is nothing but ashes.
Legend had it that when Erika was banished into Exile, she was cursed so that the slightest touch of sunlight would slay her. Those legends were clearly true.
You finally stand at the keep's main control panel, but only after paying the bitterest of costs. It is now up to you to make sure Erika's sacrifice was not in vain ...

ON THE VAHNATAI PEOPLE |The Vahnatai (pronounced Vah-Nah-Tie) are a very interesting race, only recently discovered and barely understood. They are friendly, however, and great allies to the people of Exile.
They are purely a people of the caves, living in tunnels far below Exile. They live in ecologies maintained by magic. When they have used up the nutrients of their lands, they hibernate en masse for centuries while the land restores itself.
Their magic is powerful, and based on the use and shaping of crystals. Most amazingly, the souls of their most powerful and valued ancestors are brought back in the form of large blue crystals, called Crystal Souls.
It was because of these Souls that we first discovered the Vahnatai. The Empire learned of them before us, and stole three of their Crystal Souls. A band of brave Exile adventurers recovered the Souls, proving our good intentions to them.
In return, the Vahnatai joined our side and helped turn the tide of the Empire War. They have continued to fight at our sides, and to be invaluable allies, and each day we learn more about each other.

ON DRAGONS |When Exile was discovered, it had many strange and wondrous creatures in it. Most amazing of these were the dragons. 
Five dragons lived in Exile. They were siblings, children of a mated pair we know nothing of. Motrax was the eldest, and the best friend of humankind. Alas, he died as the result of wounds suffered during the Empire War.
Most powerful was Sulfras. She was taken prisoner by the Empire during the Empire War. When Exiles rescued her, she slew many Empire soldiers, restored her horde, and disappeared. Her current location is unknown.
Pyrog was the dragon with the most rapacious nature. He had to be slain by humans not long before Hawthorne was assassinated. Athron is a recluse by nature, and hasn't been heard from for years.
Finally, Khoth was known to have a huge appetite for learning and an awesome library. However, he had the ill-fortune to be captured by the Empire and forced to aid them with his learning. After the Empire War, he was nowhere to be found.

5_724
ON THE HISTORY OF EXILE |The history of Exile is long and complicated, but may still be easily summarized. It was discovered by Empire magicians several centuries ago.
A band of soldiers and great heroes was teleported down to explore this new, wondrous land. This First Expedition was slaughtered to a man and woman. Later, the Empire had the idea of using Exile as a dumping ground for 'undesirables'.
Misfits and magical creatures alike were sent through a one way teleporter into Exile. Among these were several powerful mages, all of whom were at the losing end of a political struggle.
These were Solberg and Patrick, Rone and Linda. And, most importantly, Erika. They imprisoned the demon Grah-Hoth who ruled the caverns, and formed a nation, which they called Exile as a constant reminder that this was not our true home.
Erika, the most powerful of the mages, however, was not content. Her hatred of the Empire was absolute, and she masterminded a plan to assassinate Hawthorne, the brilliant and vicious ruler of the surface world.
The result was bloody vengeance. Garzahd, master archmage of the surface world, led an invasion force down into Exile. The troops who teleported down waged the Empire War, a conflict that ravaged Exile.
Through the help of the Vahnatai, however, we won the Empire War and slew the invaders. Our future is now uncertain, but with our new allies, perhaps we may stride boldly forward to a wondrous destiny.

As soon as you step into the middle of the circle of runes, in full view of the rows of chairs, something happens which is amazing and horrifying at the same time.
Images appear above the six runes, floating and circling slowly. They are monsters: a slime above one rune, a cockroach above another. A troglodyte, a giant, a golem, and a strange, six-legged beast float above the other runes.
You realize that this is some sort of meeting room, where the Vahnatai could examine and discuss the creatures with which they have been slaughtering the people on the surface wholesale.
After a minute, the images slowly float away. Then, with a flash, two guards appear. They move to attack.

You meet Rentar-Ihrno, master archmage of the Vahnatai and famed magical warrior in your war against the Empire, and ask her of the crystal you found underneath the giant and troglodyte fortresses.
She thinks. _This is a concern to me. Of course, we had nothing to do with its creation. We have much to deal with in the underworld as it is. We have neither the energy nor the interest to interfere with the surface as well._
_However, it is worrisome that someone is using our magical inventions to carry out such deeds. Note this. The only beings besides ourselves to have learned that much of our magic are the Exiles. You may wish to look to your own people._
That seems to be all she has to say on this subject.

With growing excitement, you read through Jordan's notes. They give a detailed account of who he is, what he did, and how he was able to create and control slimes!
It would seem he was a traveling mage of no great account, who, when traveling to Krizsan, saw a large cave while camping in some mountains. He investigated, and found it was full of the slimes.
Hiding himself with a stealth spell, he entered, and found that the cavern was a huge factory for producing the slimes. They were born and grew up in enormous pools of green goo. He carefully got a sample of this goo to take with him.
He says little else about the 'Slime Pit' except that it was in some mountains not far east of the town of Colchis (you take note of this) and that the slimes there were controlled by a huge 'Alien Slime,' whatever that is.
From there, Jordan came here, grew the slime sample into his own pool and created slimes for his own purposes. One small side note is that the pools are rather delicate. A direct fireball hit should be enough to destroy one. Interesting!
His notes make it clear that he was a courageous and brilliant man. It's a pity he was so evil, but at least this information may be a big help in ending the plague of slimes.

With a green spray and an intensely satisfying splattering noise, the slime pool flies apart. The bits of goo try to ooze back together again, but the heat hardened their surfaces.
You hear a bizarre keening noise echoing through the tunnels. You look around and hear that the sound is also coming from one the baby slimes at the edge of the destroyed pool.
The slimes are dying, killed in some odd way by the destruction of their creator. As they deflate, they emit a high pitched, agonized sound, the only sound they'll ever make in their lives.
Soon, however, the sound dies down. All the slimes have died. You have a hard time feeling bad about it.

This little town has not remained empty, however. It is occupied by spiders. Huge spiders. Lots of them. You see them moving around, standing guard, building and maintaining webs, and chatting.
Yes, chatting. These are clearly not ordinary spiders. They are talking to each other, in friendly, high-pitched, perky voices. And, when the sentries see you, they say _Hi there, humans! Come on in! We won't eat you! We promise!_
You start to feel a vague sense of disquiet.

You get close to this pile of rubble, and find that there's more to it than meets the eye. It's been piled here in tall, elaborate spires, and the ursagi have carved delicate designs into each stone with their claws.
As you look at the designs, however, you start to feel edgy and weak. You have to back away. You aren't sure whether this is some sort of odd ursagi temple, or something even more bizarre, but it's a type of dark magic you've never seen.

You find a large crystal on a pedestal. It's a beautiful, delicate stone. However, there is a light flickering inside it, moving back and forth as if it was alive. The light is a ugly, sickly green.
As you look at the stone, you hear a voice in your heads. It says _Thank you for saving my home from its evil invaders! Now, at last, I can rest happily. Blessings upon you!_
After that there is only silence. About all you could do is break the crystal, if you wanted. Do you?

Your final blow shatters the mind crystal into a thousand pieces. There is no explosion. You see no lightning or similar pyrotechnics.
Instead, you hear a soft, distant keening. A being rises from the crystal, an ethereal, writhing cloud. It begins to fade away, howling as it goes.
Finally, it's gone. The effect is immediate. All the nearby golems collapse. Below you, you can hear the machines start to hum and rumble, running out of control now that their master is gone.
The tower shakes with a series of explosions. Maybe machines are exploding, or maybe golems are running wild, destroying everything in sight.

You shatter the massive crystal! When you do, it sends one last pulse of energy into the air - where it goes, you aren't sure. Then the shards of crystal crumble into dust.

The energy fields behind you die down as you finally enter the highest chamber in the golem's infernal factory. Before, you were unsure who was controlling the golems or how they were doing it. Now things become clear to you.
To the north, you see an enormous crystal, similar to the power crystals you've already destroyed, but much larger and brighter. Its light adds a fiery sheen to everything in the room.
When you enter, the crystal is talking. At least, you presume that's what that strange chittering noise is. You realize it must be sending commands to the machinery, and to the golems as well. The thing must actually be intelligent!
If you could somehow destroy it, it may irreparably damage the golem army. The problem is that doing so may be rather tricky. One of the crystal's guards has detected you, and they have begun to move to attack.

You stand before the black altar, sitting in the middle of a courtyard of marble slabs. Although it's clearly been here for a long, long time, everything looks as new as if it was finished this morning.
The altar almost seems to shimmer with power. You have a hard time focusing your eyes on it. If you concentrate really hard, you think you can see beings moving around inside.
Suddenly, you are struck by an incredibly powerful compulsion. You feel an almost irresistible urge to smash the altar, to strike it with one of your weapons very hard. Do you?

Dazed, you raise your blade above your head, and bring it down on the altar as hard as you can. A small hairline fracture appears in the stone. It's doesn't seem large enough to make a difference.
Then, the altar develops a huge crack down the front. The air around you fills with hideous demonic laughter. The laughter turns into babbling, and the babble resolves into one deafening call: _I'm free!_
Three clouds of flame seep quickly out of the crack, land some distance away, and form into massive demons. They're the lords of demonkind, the haakai, and they're each twenty feet high! They look down on you as if you were insects.
Then, amused, one of them speaks. _Centuries we've been held here, sending out spells to summon others to us. Those spells formed the stone circles, and the circles were what you submitted to! Now we are free, and now our reign can begin!_
The second one chuckles. _We hunger, and you look tasty. However, we are not ungrateful for your service. We offer you a deal. Give us your treasure, all of it, and we will spare you. Refuse, and die._
The third says _Speak quickly, for we have much to do, and much strength to regain. Do you agree?_

You build up a massive bolt of holy energy and throw it at the altar. However, it does not have the desired effect. It engulfs the altar in golden flame, but the altar seems to be absorbing it, turning it from its intended purpose.

You reach a large, muggy cavern, dominated by a massive bubbling fumarole in the middle. You stare through the thick mist, looking for signs of life.
Unfortunately, it doesn't take long to spot them. Two massive, sinuous shapes shift about in the distance. They are drakes, each several times your height. The larger one speaks:
_I am Drakos, queen of drakes, and I am pleased that, for once, our food has come to us! Your fate will match that of the last group of puny humans that came here!_
The drake lords begin to laugh. You start to draw your weapons, only to find that your location has suddenly changed.

The book is a diary - a partial record of the excavation of this ancient ruin, written by someone named Dariad.
Day 1 - Arrived at site. Had a dozen men, three of them mages, and thirty strong Empire altered giants for excavations. Very exciting. Who knows who might have created this site?
Day 12 - Going well. Have broken into a strange shaft, leading down. Found traces of odd slime. Intriguing!
Day 20 - Things continue to go well. The slime attack that felled poor Sason could happen at any site, and the odd behavior of the giants does not worry me. The mutant creatures are legendary for their loyalty.
Day 30 - Almost to lower level. Things continue to go well. The giant that attacked Esther was swiftly punished, and the general moodiness of the giants will pass. They seem to be making carvings in their off time. Anything to relax them.
Day 35 - Things continue to go well. Yet, the strange dreams we have begun to have are making us slightly edgy. One of the giants refused an order today! She said something like 'I follow the wyrm._ Punishments will be meted out tomorrow.
This is the last entry.
Day 5 - Things are going well. Found signs that this is indeed the crypt of Sairios! Recovery of his legendary crossbow would be a great triumph for our expedition.

You reach the bodies, and are able to examine them closely. They were human males. They've been dead for some time now. However, decomposition has been slow, for a very grisly reason.
These men were not killed by chitrachs, as you might have expected. They were burned to death, by intensely severe (and almost undoubtedly magical) flames. It would seem the chitrachs don't like to eat burned meat.
The question is: who would sear these men to death and just leave them here, and why?

You get close enough to examine the north end of the cavern, and what you see is chilling. This was once the south end of what must have been a very long gallery, which has now been sealed off.
The corridor was blocked off by a rockfall so extreme it must have been felt for miles around. The scorch marks and signs of melting on the ceiling tell you what must have caused it: incredible magical force.
You search the rubble of the cavern to try to figure out who was here and why they did what they did. At first, it seems like the search will be futile, until you notice the glint of metal under some gravel.
It's a finely polished steel key. It's of normal size, but of a very peculiar twisted, looping design. There are no marks on it, or other indication of who might have made it. 
It's the only significant thing you find. Discouraged, you take it with you. It looks like this is as far as you're going to go.

After much journeying and many battles, you seem to have come to the goal of your quest. It's a pedestal with a crystal on it. The crystal is only a foot high, its small size amazing considering the incredible power that rests inside it.
A narrow beam of blinding white light extends from the crystal to the two  massive magical barriers, one to the north and one to the south. The beam of light is the conduit for the energy that keeps the barriers active and stable.
You know that many evil creatures are pent up on the other sides of the barriers, and that those dealing with a magical artifact of this power must be very careful, or be slain. Or worse.
Bearing that in mind, it would be very  easy to smash the crystal creating the barriers. Do you? 
1_63

One of the drawbacks of putting this much energy in an inanimate object (such as a crystal) is that the energy must be very delicately balanced, and thus that it will take very little to upset it.

It takes you a few minutes to get back up off the ground without falling back down again. You survey the carnage: a blackened pedestal, surrounded by broken shards of crystal, the thick smell of ozone, and two newly unblocked passages.
Suddenly, a glowing, insubstantial figure appears in front of you, floating above the pedestal. It says, simply, _They will make you pay for this. You have far yet to journey. In Gale and Blackcrag lie the keys._ Then it disappears.
Before you have time to digest this, you are interrupted yet again. Troglodytes run through the southern passage, coming to see what caused the explosion. Giants come from the north, searching for their natural enemies, the troglos.
These two foes each face a field filled with their enemies and emit joyous battle cries. Unfortunately, you're right between them, and humans count as enemies to both sides ...
You have restarted the war between the troglodytes and the giants. By causing them to waste their energy against each other, you have saved many human lives. The question now is whether you'll survive long enough to enjoy your victory.

You realize now who has been helping you, and is now sitting right in front of you: the legendary Bon-Ihrno. He is the Vahnatai who first urged his people to make peace with Exile, and who brought the first humans to Vahnatai lands.
For years now, he has been revered by both your people and his as the brave architect of peace and a veritable fount of wisdom. And now here he is, in this remote hut, trying to help you.

THE WAY OF THE SACRED ITEM
by Zalactar of the Sacred Item
Oh, I write of the joy of items, of the powers that mere stone and rock and metal and paper and gem can hold. Lo, they are gifts of the Gods, they will be here after us, we must give thanks for the Gods benevolence.
So we must be guided in that which will be here long after us, and follow the lessons. Firstly, it is true that they must not be used, for doing so puts them at risk, and verily, they are here to be here long after us.
And lo, secondly, the search for new Gifts Of The Gods must never end, and the Sacred Mighty Quest to obtain them must never end, for every day a Sacred Item is owned by the unholy is a needle in the eye of God.
And thus lo, we reach the second, which is that we must refine ourselves and purge our weaknesses, so that we may live up to the Sacred Expectations of the Sacred Items! All one! All one! DILUTE! DILUTE!
Follow you, and lo, the Gods Will Watch Over Us, when their Gifts are touched and protected and loved by us! Follow us! Follow us!

You find an interesting book: |  THE MYSTERY OF THE STONE CIRCLES |  by Zalvan Ordravi
Of the many mysteries of magic that present themselves to us, one of the most intriguing and enigmatic is that of the stone circles on the continent of Valorim.
They disappear and reappear. One there one day will be gone the next. Those travelers who enter them feel compelled to pray. When they do, they feel peculiar afterwards, but stronger. Or smarter. Or refreshed.
Who made them? What are they for? Some wizards say they are the tool of a dark power, and should be destroyed. Others say that we shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. Nobody knows the truth.
Interestingly, there are five areas in Valorim where the circles tend to be sighted: the Isle of Bigail, around Lake Tomor, Krizsan Province, near Gale, and on the Libras-Squiggus caravan route.
What should one do upon encountering a stone circle? Nobody is sure, but I personally believe that caution is the key to success in magic. After all, 'He who sticks his head into the orifice of a dragon will not be pleased with the result.'

You find an interesting book: |  The Early History of Valorim, Vol. 1 |  by Zagnut
When the Empire turned its mighty eye to the continent of Valorim, it was settled only by fierce, mindless Nephilim and similar monsters. The tale of the Empire's taming of this savage continent is a long and exciting one!
The first settlement in Valorim was Blackcrag Fortress, a mighty fortress at the north end. The early building of this fort, which provided a safe place for settlers and a supply depot, was the key to the destruction of the Nephilim tribes.
From this stronghold, settlers were able to establish the Keep of Tinraya, the largest and mightiest city in Valorim. The Keep's mighty walls and limited access makes it, quite possibly, the Empire city safest from attack.
From the Keep, lightning raids by Empire Dervishes were able to devastate the mighty Ratbane clan of Nephilim. This cleared the way to the founding of Gale and Lorelei.
The tale of the taming of the southern half of the continent will follow in Volume 2, coming soon.

_It's a shame,_ he says. _I do miss my home, and I sometimes feel like a coward staying out here, but I do help out with the war._ You ask how. He pulls out a case and opens it. It's full of potions.
_Plenty of good herbs out here, for those who know where to find 'em. I ship potions east to help the fighters, only keeping and selling what I need to get gold to stay alive. And that reminds me ..._ He smiles innocently.
He offers to sell you high quality potions. Do you accept?

Remembering what the people of Calloc told you, you look around for this fierce band of Nephilim you're supposed to deal with. Searching, you eventually find them in a small canyon. They aren't quite what you expected, however.
There's about thirty of them, many unarmed, most underfed. They're all huddled around a bonfire, eating a thin stew. They seem completely unaware of your presence.

The moment they see you, most of them charge for the hills, trying to get away. The pathetic force that remains, when they see you don't plan to attack, walks up to speak with you.
One of them, as underfed as all the rest, says _I am Mrrmrrr, the chief of the Ratbane clan. As you can see, our clan has fallen on hard times. Why do you come to speak with us?_ You explain what the people of Calloc said. He looks alarmed.
_Raiding Calloc? That would be our clan's final suicide. No, we were hunting, tracking several bears whose spoor we had found._
_We found the bears eating crops by Calloc. However, we dared not attack - the bears were led by ursagi! They were too smart and fierce for us, so we fled, but not before the humans saw us._
_We followed the ursagi, though. They live in a valley only a little east of Calloc, not far at all. They are the ones you hunt, not us!_ You ask a few more questions, but learn nothing else of interest, and the chief goes to find his clan.

You knock on the door, and are greeted by Vlosto. He's a Nepharim, member of a subbreed of the Nephilim, larger but sterile. He welcomes you in for ale, which you try, and roast giant rat, which you have doubts about.
He explains that he can increase the archery skills of those who are not already too trained in it. A lesson for one of you will be a mere 3000 gold. Do you train?

When you get close to the man, you see his simple farmers garb actually has fine gold thread runes woven into it. He's actually a mage! He greets you, and introduces himself as _Toras._
He invites you in for lunch, and you talk for a bit about the state of things in the area. The most significant thing he says is that the Keep of Tinraya was to the northwest. However, it has been quarantined and walled off.
When you ask why, Toras says that the keep was overwhelmed by a plague of monsters: hideous six-legged beasts that tore the town apart. The Empire built a huge magical wall around the place, to keep the beasts in before they spread.
Eventually, Toras completes the tale and says he needs to return to work. You bid him farewell, and depart.

Guards surround an encampment, in which alchemists are busily boiling and refining bundles of leaves, reducing them to a gray-green pulpy mush. It's this process that puts off the smell. 
Whatever they're doing, however, it's not at all innocent. The guards spot you easily in the wide open valley, and immediately grab weapons. They may well try to spit you if you move any closer. Do you approach?

She looks you up and down. _Adventurers. Hmmph. That's all I need! Here I am, overwhelmed with utter sadness, and in addition, I have to deal with big, smelly oafs tromping my begonias._
_I have half a mind to make you grow the ears of an ass, or be forever cursed, or something like that. But I am merciful, like nature herself. If you can improve my mood, I will spare you._
_I am sad, because it has been hundreds of years since I have seen something truly beautiful. I'm sure you understand. And you might be able to make me feel better. Do you have something beautiful to show me?_

You reach the end of the valley and find a large cave entrance, smelling of sulphur. You listen, and hear nothing inside. Do you go in?

There is a large holly bush growing on the riverbed. Holly is not a very powerful alchemy ingredient, but definitely has its uses. Some of the berries even look fresh and usable.

You reach the valley, and immediately see a view that brings a tear to your eye. It has been many years since you've seen the surface, those of you who have seen it at all.
And, after years of dreaming, here it finally is, laid out before you. Plants are everywhere, and you feel wind, and the sky is a blue richer than any you've ever seen. It's warm, and dry, and there can be no doubt you are finally home.
You stand there for an hour, just admiring the sight and feeling the sensations. You then make a more careful inspection. This area is very unsettled. There's a river to the south, but no humans settlements as far as you can see.
This is excellent news. Not only is Fort Emergence under no immediate danger of attack, but there is plenty of room around here for Exiles to live.
But it wouldn't do to get too excited, too soon. There's still plenty to be discovered, and plenty of investigation to do. You'll have to meet the surface people, who are likely to be very different from you. 
Also, while there is great joy in leaving the caves, it's far more frightening than you thought it would be. After years of tunnels and shadows, the open sky and bright sun leave you feeling constantly blinded and exposed.
You are facing momentous events, and the beginning of an exciting (and dangerous) new age. A new land awaits you ... it's time to explore.

In this isolated vale, you find a stone circle. Huge, carved stones covered with abstract designs loom over you. The place is almost overgrown and clearly ancient.
The sky over the circle is clearer and sunnier than anywhere around, and the air seems fresher. It's a very inviting place. Enter?

You intended to look at the designs and search the place a bit, but once inside, your attention is completely grabbed by the altar. The featureless stone in the center completely, inexplicably and totally seizes your attention.
You suddenly feel that it would be an excellent idea to kneel at the stone. What do you do?

As you search the hills, you find the six foot high pile of stones you were told about. You poke around in the pile, and find several lumps of something that seems like metal, but is far too light and lusterless. It's quite unusual.

You approach nervously, and find a small, scraggly man with a wand. He says _Sorry. With all the goblins about, I tend to lob spells first and look after.   I'm Bulon. Care to come in for stew?_
You enter his hut, and find that the stew is repellent. You also notice that the hut is full of alchemical equipment. You ask Bulon about it.
He says _Yeah, I'm doin' alchemy stuff out here. Best to work away from towns, just to keep from fryin' people. Just found a great recipe for Weak Poison, using Holly. Interested?_

You know enough about the different sorts of plants on the surface to know that these flowers are quite useful. They're glowing nettle, an alchemical ingredient!

In a small cave in the hillside, you find an ancient Nephilim shaman, so old he's become bald in patches. In a purring voice, he tells you he has alchemical herbs available for sale or barter. Interested?

5_438
The Nephilim are normally a very lithe race, but this one would be muscular for a human! He has a small forge set up, and is, with long, painstaking effort, forging some beautiful weapons. He tries to sell one of them to you. Shop?

You stand at the entrance to a large valley. It is blocked by a rough stone wall, manned by a bunch of armed and wary Nephilim. Looking beyond, you see they have a large village up there.
The valley entrance is heavily defended, and for good reason. In plain sight, you see a large group of ursagi and goblins. The vicious, intelligent bears are getting ready to launch an attack. The battle would no doubt kill many Nephilim.
Right now, this isn't your fight. However, you could easily make it yours...

You stand at the entrance to a large valley. It is blocked by a rough stone wall, manned by a bunch of armed and wary Nephilim. Looking beyond, you see they have a large village up there.
Much of the damage from the ursagi attack still remains, and Nephilim of all ages and both sexes are working to repair it. The village beyond is still intact. Do you approach?

5_708
You reach the far end of the valley, passing more and more beautiful flora as you go. Finally, at the very top, you find a patch of flowers that makes all the rest look plain by comparison.
In the middle grows a very small rosebush. In its center grows a single rose, a perfect specimen of the species, flawless in petal and rich in smell. It you wished, you could pick the flower and take it with you.
1_63
You stand in the middle of a wide plain. It's a beautiful, sunny day. Green grass waves in the wind. A herd of deer grazes in the distance. It's utterly beautiful.
It's also completely unspoiled, and the rich land is capable of supporting many, many people. If the Exiles wanted to come to the surface, there is plenty of room for them to live. All you need to do is become safe from the empire. Somehow.

5_708
You manage to get close to the Nephilim settlement without being seen. The chilling sight of the armor of several Exile soldiers sitting empty by their cooking pot confirms your suspicious - these Nephilim are bandits, and worse.
There aren't that many of them, and you have the advantage of surprise. You may be able to rid Upper Exile of these butchers...

You explore the crude village. You easily decide to leave the food behind. Fortunately, they have a bit of gold and other goods. In addition, there is an intriguing bone necklace around the neck of the chief.

A careful search of this mushroom field pays off. In a small crevasse you find a cache which has been sitting here for some time. The food is rotten, but there is a sack of copper coins and a quiver full of still-usable arrows to be taken.

As you approach the door, it opens, revealing a withered old woman with long, snowy white hair. _What are you skulking about out here for?_ she chuckles. _I am Silverlocke. Come in! Come in!_
Everyone in Exile has heard of Silverlocke, master alchemist and potion maker. You enter, and after being served tea and biscuits, she offers to show you the goods she has for sale. Do you shop?

Nearby, you see a Vahnatai hunting party bearing wicked, wavy swords. They move effortlessly among the stalagmites. It looks like they have some sort of prey trapped in a depression in the cave floor.
One of them sees you watching, and makes a quick motion for you to come over and help. Do you?

You find a dead Vahnatai, stabbed to death and hurriedly concealed behind some rubble in this remote cavern. Looks like the work of bandits. 
You search the area, and find they must have been in quite a hurry. They left some of their victim's razordisks behind.

You reach the end of the passage, and find it has been sealed. Thousands of tons of shattered rock close the tunnel off. You look at the ceiling and see the signs of a massive magical blow, used to cause the rockfall.
It is clear that the Vahnatai have left your lands, and left for good. Two chilling questions hang in the thick, dusty air: Where did they go, and can they be stopped?

This is clearly an area that relies heavily on mining. One bit of evidence leading you to that conclusion is this tunnel into the ground, shored up by thick, heavy pillars and guarded by two nasty looking soldiers. Do you enter?

Not far inside the mine entrance, you find a small foundry. Rich iron ore from the mine below is brought up and immediately processed in small batches, using small but intensely hot magical fires.
You don't stand around for long before a mage approaches you, flanked by two massive guards. The mage says _I am Ragos. Greetings. Do you come for good or ill?_ You explain you were just exploring, and he relaxes.
_Well,_ he says, _I'm afraid we can't let you stay. We're very busy, and you'll get in the way. However, before you go, I should mention that we make excellent iron weapons here, at a fraction of the normal cost._
_We can give you a great deal if you are interested._ Are you?

The farmers welcome you in warmly. You find out that the son of one of the families was sent into Exile some years previous, for _being a little funny._ You can see the anger in their eyes, fresh after all these years.
They ask you if you ever saw him. You haven't, but they are still greatly relieved to hear that Exile is still there and doing OK. They are so grateful that they offer to sell you some of their crops, at a discount. Accept?

You move into the crag between these two rock spires, and stumble upon a large goblin encampment. Several of them are wolf-riders ... they could easily give chase to you if they wanted.
One of the warriors calls to you: _You humans good food. Give us 50 of your coins, or we catch you and feed your grokbogs to our wolves!_ You aren't sure, but you really doubt you want to give them your grokbogs. Do you pay?

The hill dwellers allow you to approach. Their elder, a gray haired, aromatic old gentleman, comes to the gate to greet you. _Hi,_ he croaks.
_Normally, anyone gets this close, we stick 'em, on account they might have slimes with 'em. Now that the slimes is gone, we open for business._
He hawks, spits, and holds up a brown clay jug. _We makes this stuff, and nobody else does. Sells it for a good price. Hurts like hell goin' down, but picks you right up. Want some?_

This valley is infested by more slimes than you thought possible. Viscous goo drips from every available surface, and there is an eerie lack of any non-slime life, plant or animal. 
A large collection of the mindless predators waits up the path. They don't approach ... they seem to be guarding the path. What do you do?

Reaching the end of a secluded path, you find the center of the volcanic activity in this area - a massive fumarole, bubbling hot mud and sulphurous gas.
You can't really concentrate on the view, however. Your attention is seized by the drake bathing in the mud. It's the biggest such creature you've ever seen - 30 feet high and 50 feet from head to tail.
It sees you when you see it. It doesn't seem hostile, but that could change at any moment. Attack it?

It walks over to you slowly and somberly. Each step of the massive creature crushes stone. When it's close, it begins to speak. Little flames come out with each word.
_I am Stergnos, Lord among Drakes! I wish to purchase the aid of a few humans, and you will do. Some smaller members of my kind have threatened to come here and fall upon me, hoping for the wealth and status such an attack would confer._
It chuckles deeply. _I feel I could defeat them, but I did not reach this age by being incautious. If you help ensure my victory, I will reward you. Will you?_

MThis bow is a long, elegantly curved piece of wood, with a nice polish on it.:These are arrows, suitable for firing from any decent bow.@You have come across truly fine examples of the fletcher's art. 
Darts intended for use in combat are not like standard issue darts for gaming in pubs. Combat darts are eight to twelve inches long, with feather fletching and wicked, barbed tips.
These darts have shining, polished tips of some rare and strong metal, rare feathers along their length, and a general air of refined deadliness.
The razordisk is the missile weapon of choice for the Vahnatai warrior. It is a metal disk, 4-6 inches in diameter, polished and with edges of intense sharpness. They are beautiful weapons.YA javelin is a 5-6 foot long, slender lance of metal, easy to throw and deadly on impact.CThis is a delicate glass bottle containing a sparkling blue liquid.3This is a ceramic jar containing murky ocher fluid.EThis is a rough glass bottle containing a truly nasty smelling fluid.hThis is a corked, slender vial containing syrupy red liquid. It almost, but not quite, looks like blood.BThis is a small ceramic jug. Odorless fluid sloshes around inside.XThis tiny vial contains a minuscule amount of clear fluid. You have to squint to see it.<This small jar is filled with a musty-smelling green liquid.'The fluid in this bottle is dead black.
iThis scroll is a thin sheet of some sort of lizard hide, wrapped tightly around a polished piece of wood.{This is an ancient piece of parchment, threatening to fall apart at the slightest breeze. It is covered with strange runes.jThis is a piece of the finest vellum, which has arcane characters carefully inscribed on it in gold paint.
This scroll is actually several sheets of parchment, tied together with a leather thong. They are covered with glyphs and sigils.HThis is a sheet of rather ordinary seeming parchment with writing on it.BThis is a long, thin piece of ivory with a red crystal at the end.
Elegant cannot begin to describe this piece of oak, intricately, lovingly carved into a long, curving shape, with tiny, almost invisible writing covering its entire surface.FThis is a long sliver of bone, which feels slightly warm to the touch.dThis is a long, thin rod of steel, with tiny bits of polished amethyst and onyx set into its length.IThis is a long, thin piece of wood, painted black except for a white tip.
A torch is a length of wood with one end covered with some sort of gooey, flammable substance (usually sap). They cast a decent amount of light for a reasonable amount of time. Torches tend to attract adventurers, much as gross things attract roaches.
These are lockpicks - an assortment of lengths of wire, bits of metal, tiny saws,  and other goods used to make locked doors become not quite so locked.
These are very nice lockpicks, clearly designed for the professional locksmith. They are excellent tools for those who want to be places other people don't want them.
This is a rock. It's a small chunk of stone, neither rare nor valuable. If things get really desperate, you can wing it at someone's head. It might also make a nice souvenir of your adventure.
A bolt is like an arrow, but shorter and thicker. It is created for use in that most dangerous of missile weapons, the crossbow.vSapphires are small, blue gems. They are beautiful and valuable, much in demand for both jewelry and spell components.
Smoky Crystals are pieces of smoky quartz, carefully cut and polished to help them focus magical energy. They are needed to cast the Mindduel spell.
This is a pot of sticky, gooey, ill-smelling substance, designed to be smeared on a weapon. Poison can be used on melee weapons, arrows, and crossbow bolts. As the poisoned weapon is used, the strength of the poison decreases.
This is a javelin with silver wires running down the length and (and this is very peculiar) a blue crystal at the tip instead of a sharp metal point. ]This is a pouch of fine white powder, almost like flour, but with tiny silver sparkles in it.FThis is a vial of something a lot like sand, but with a reddish tinge.-This is a pouch of very fine metallic powder.
A glowstone is a semiprecious stone, like an agate, with a very mild enchantment. When rubbed, it begins to cast a strong light, which lasts for quite a while.
A buckler is a small, round shield, designed to be strapped to the forearm. It is not very bulky, although it is of minimal help when using a two-handed weapon.
This is a lightweight shield, about a foot and a half across. Using it fully occupies one of your hands. It doesn't get in your way much, and provides decent protection.
A large shield is a large, heavy piece of work, designed to shield the whole torso, and some of the legs as well. It is fairly awkward to use, however ... expect a small drop in accuracy in combat.
This is a beautiful shield. It is crafted of fine metal, carefully polished, and has an elegant geometrical design across its surface. It looks brand new.yThis is a very heavy leather vest. It is light, easy to move in, and will provide a small amount of protection in combat.
This is a full suit of thick leather, boiled in wax to make it very hard. Leather armor is excellent for the adventurer on a budget. Also, it will never interfere with spell-casting.

Revive AlltWhen cast, the party receives a powerful healing (increasing with level of	the caster) and has poison cured as well.

Major Cleansing7This spell removes all webs and disease from the party.
Strength
Measures how much brute strength the character possesses. High strength increases damage done in combat, improves odds of kicking down doors, and has other, more subtle effects.	Dexterity
Measure how nimble the character is. High dexterity gives a better chance of hitting in combat (esp. with missile weapons) and makes the character harder to hit. High dexterity also makes picking locks and disarming traps easier.
Intelligence
Measures mental strength and dexterity. High intelligence also makes your spells more effective, sometimes very much so. Intelligence below 4 makes your spells works poorly.
Edged Weapons5Makes you better at using daggers, swords, axes, etc.
Bashing Weapons=Makes you better at using clubs, maces, hammers, flails, etc.
Pole Weapons=Makes you better at using spears of all sorts, halberds, etc.
Thrown Missiles=Makes you better at using darts, javelins, and throwing axes.
Archery+Makes you better at using a bow and arrows.
Defense

Mage Spells
YHaving a certain level of this skill enables you to cast mage spells of up to that level.
Priest Spells[Having a certain level of this skill enables you to cast priest spells of up to that level.	Mage Lore
You will occasionally need to decipher strange magical readings. This skill determines how good you are at this. If your skill is high enough, you may gain a spell or a valuable piece of information.
Alchemy

Having Item Lore skill gives you a chance of having the items from slain monsters be identified when you find them. The more of this skill that is present, the higher the chance of this happening.
Disarm Traps
Many chests and some corridors will have traps on them, which can be devastating. The higher this skill, the better your chance of disarming them.
Lockpicking
Many towns and dungeons will have locked doors. A PC with some of this skill and lock picks equipped can try to pick them. The higher this skill, the better.
Assassination
Sometimes, when a character attacks a much weaker monster, the blow will do a good deal of extra damage. The more of this skill you have, the better the chance of this happening, and the stronger the monsters it can happen to.
Poison
You will find poisons, which you can put on your weapons for a extra damage. Having a few levels in this skill will make it more likely you will put the poison on at full strength, and the less likely you will nick yourself with the poison accidentally.
Luck
This skill is expensive, but can be a bargain at twice the cost. Its effects are pervasive, subtle, powerful, and sometimes irreplaceable.

Alchemy and Poison
Alchemy can be incredibly useful. Potions can give you the added boost you may need to get through a long grueling dungeon, and you cannot raise the dead without the right concoction.
You need three things to make a potion:|1. High alchemy skill. When a character tries to make a potion, his/her alchemy skill must be above a certain level. The higher above that level, the better the chance for success.
2. The right ingredient. Ingredients are usually found at special encounters outdoors, and regenerate themselves after a time. Generally, the person who teaches a recipe tells you what plant it needs.m3. The recipe. These are usually bought in towns. You only need to buy each recipe once for the entire party.
When you have all these things, go into a town and click on the blue bottle button. Pick the PC with the highest alchemy skill to make the potion. Hope.
Here is a list of the alchemical concoctions, with min. skill to make:|Weak Poison|  Min. Skill - 1|Need toadstools or spider glands. The lowest level poison.FWeak Curing|  Min.

vOne of the most useful things you can make with alchemy is poison, a powerful weapon in the magic-poor world of Exile.
Many monsters are immune to magic and fire. However, not many are poison-resistant. This makes poison an excellent mage-killer.
To poison a weapon, use it during combat. Your hand-to-hand weapon (the first one, if two are equipped) or arrows will become poisoned. Each time you attack, the level of poison decreases.
Don't poison a weapon too long before combat. Its effectiveness decreases with time. Also, switching weapons makes the poison disappear.
Poisoning an already poisoned weapon doesn't do much good. The weapon gets the maximum poison level of the poison being added or the poison already there, no more.
Anaximander looks up from his desk. _Don't forget ... The sooner you go out onto the surface and see what's going on, the better. All Exile waits to see whether it is safe to emerge or not._
You report to Anaximander on seeing the strange slime creature. He looks very serious. _This is bizarre, to say the least. The Empire was determined to purge the world of all that was different or dangerous._
_Yet, it seems that dangerous creatures, at the height of the Empire's power, are returning. Continue to investigate this situation. This is something we need to learn much more about._
You report how the mayor of Krizsan enlisted you to fight the slime creatures. Anaximander says _How strange. After so many years fearing and fighting the Empire, our agents our now helping it._
_Nonetheless, continue on your mission. We must find as much as we can about these creatures, including, possibly, where they came from. After all, they threaten the place we want to become our home._
You tell Anaximander everything about the destruction of the alien slime, and he looks much more worried than before. _You see what this means, don't you? Some very powerful creature, with great magical ability, launched a mighty attack on the surface._
_This is grim in the extreme. The best that can happen is that the Empire will blame us and attack us anew. The worst is that the attacker has the power to make the surface unlivable, and we will be doomed to Exile forever!_
_It is clear that your mission is becoming much more important than we thought. We need you to get a lot of information for us, not just a brief survey of the fort's surroundings._
_Keep exploring the surface, and find out as much as you can about these monsters. More importantly, find out where they came from. Otherwise, they may come for us! And if you find any evidence of who might be responsible, take it to Berra._
Anixamander twitches in revulsion when you describe the giant roaches to him. _And I thought the slimes were awful! It is clear that this is yet another monster infestation. Investigate, and destroy them if you can!_
You tell Anaximander of the fiery destruction of the roaches pits. He nods. _Well done. I would support their destruction on general principles. Continue to explore the surface._
You tell Anaximander of the troglodytes, and the destruction they are wreaking. He nods. _Yes. I have heard of the troglodytes from other sources as well,_ he says enigmatically.
_They breed fast, and are vicious warriors. However, I have heard that their lair is near that of their great enemy ... the hill giants. Go explore ... maybe their enmity can be exploited._
You tell Anaximander of the war between the humans and the Hill Giants. _The giants attacked the humans out of nowhere and ruined their cities, eh? Sounds very, very familiar. Probably another symptom of our same problem._
_Investigate the giants, and also look for and deal with the troglodytes. The two hate each other, or so I have heard. Perhaps this may be taken advantage of._
You tell Anaximander of the war that just broke out between the troglodytes and the hill giants, and your role in it. _Well done!_ he exults. _With them gone, we should have a much better chance of settling on the surface!_
_Of course, to do that we need to know both that we are safe from other monsters and from the Empire. So keep exploring. I feel much remains to be done._
When you describe the golems to him, Anaximander seems to age before your eyes. _This is far worse than anything that came before! It seems the closer the enemies are to the Empire's center, the more deadly they are._w_I cannot imagine what could be powerful enough to create an army of golems, but they must be identified, and stopped!_
Anaximander shakes his head in admiration as you describe how you slew the golems and their creators. _Still,_ he says, _our task is far from completed. After all, their creators are still at large, and if they created such an army once, they can again._
_Find out who created them, and convince them, by words or sword, not to destroy the surface! Only then can we have hope of returning to our home!_ Anaximander sits down, shaking his head in worry.
You describe the fearsome alien beasts, and the havoc they have wrought, to Anaximander. His sole response is to sit down and shake his head, overwhelmed.
You tell Anaximander how you learned that Empress Prazac would be at Blackcrag Fortress. He looks intrigued. _I have heard, you would be interested to know, that while the Empress is fully as intelligent as her dark predecessor, she is much more just._
_If you can, see if you can find a way to get in and speak with her. If she sees that we wish only to coexist and share her interest in preserving the surface, perhaps by her hand we may at last regain our home._
You describe your meeting with Prazac, and Anaximander looks delighted. _I will report this with great joy! All I have heard indicates that Prazac is a woman of her word! At last, at long, long last, we have a hope of a home on the surface!_
He turns to you, and grows serious. _We will now exert all our efforts to finding those who created these plagues of monsters and bringing them to justice. You, we believe, are our best hope. So go forth, all of you, and win us a home!_
Anaximander unzips his robe and steps from it. His body is much better developed than you would have thought. The reward for your long, hard adventures is at hand!
Anaximander looks pleased to see you. _Listen,_ he says, _there have been some strange murders up by New Formello. The circumstances are so bizarre I cannot help but want you to investigate. Come talk to me, so I can tell you more._
Anaximander asks about the murder investigation. _I'm glad you talked to Flanagan, but I am not yet satisfied we know what happened. I am sure it involved powerful magic, and remember ... we are looking for unknown, powerful magicians._
You tell Anaximander how you investigated the murder site. _Well,_ he says, _perhaps you should look a little harder. You say there was a small tunnel that went in further? Be sure to search that carefully._
You tell Anaximander about the rubble near the murder site near New Formello. _Ah! A key! Very intriguing._ He looks at it, and takes notes in it. _Keep it ... it may come in handy. And be sure to speak with Flanagan again._
You describe the conclusion of your murder investigation to Anaximander. _Well done. We do not know who killed those men, but we have still learned much. Now, back to the surface for you! Much is left to be done!_
You enter Anaximander's office and immediately see from his face that something is horribly wrong. _Demons have taken the Tower of Magi! They've sealed it off from Exile, and are summoning more of their kind._
_If something is not done, they will soon have the force to decimate Exile and slay everyone there! The only way into the Tower, we think, is the portal in the Portal Fortress, and the only group we can send to do anything is yours!_
He is clearly terrified. _Come in and speak to me, so I can tell you where to go. If you don't get down there soon, our land and all in it are doomed._
Anaximander greets you. _I heard what you did at the tower. We all owe you a great debt. I've seen to it that Levy has something very nice for you._
_Solberg and 'X' are here now. They managed to escape, thank goodness. Should you need to go to them for rewards in the future, they're puttering around somewhere nearby._
Anaximander greets you, a disgusted look on his face. _There's been a theft!_ he spits. _Right in the middle of Fort Emergence! A band of bandits managed to get in and steal the Orb of Thralni right out from under our noses._
_You should go speak to Levy. We really need to get it back ... it's an invaluable item. He was the caretaker, and may have an idea of what happened to it._
You tell Anaximander you recovered the Orb of Thralni. He nods in approval. _Our opinion of your skills improves. We've talked it over, and we believe the Orb may do a lot more good in your hands. Just try to hang on to it._
Anaximander greets you. _I heard of our discovery with regards to the Vahnatai. When we enlisted their help in the Empire War, we had no idea of the cost ... their vendetta against the Empire will never end until our home is destroyed._
_They are a powerful and intelligent foe, skilled in magic and weaponry. Exercise the greatest care, and stop them. They are our friends no longer. Defeat them, and save our homeland._
You tell Anaximander of your first meeting with Empress Prazac, and give him the scroll she gave you. He nods, tells you to wait, and leaves.sYou wait for two days. When you try to return to your rooms, guards stop you. Food is brought to you, and you wait.
Eventually, Anaximander returns and says _I have been in communication with King Micah. He believes this is our greatest opportunity, but only if we are careful. Very, very careful._
He hands you a scroll, sealed with the seal of Exile. _Take this to Empress Prazac, and return as soon as you can with her response._
You tell Anaximander of what you saw on the surface. He doesn't seem surprised. _Hmm. So far, it sounds much like what we expected. We are in the outskirts of the Empire, far from the center of civilization._
_There may still be hope that we can force some sort of colony up there. First, however, we need to learn much more. Go out and explore more, and report back._
You describe the runes you found in the Alien Slime's lair, and how they are Erika's symbols. He shakes his head, and look very concerned. _Erika is our greatest archmage, and her hatred for the Empire is absolute._
_The possibility that she may be responsible for the ravaging of the surface is both unsettling and plausible. You should go try to speak with her. She lives at the north end of this cavern, far north of Ghikra._
You tell Anaximander of the dragon scales you discovered in the cockroach pit. He looks disturbed. _Two of the three dragons still living in Exile, Khoth and Sulfras, recently disappeared. They both have the power necessary to create the monsters._
_They were attacked and enslaved by the Empire during the Empire War ... they despise the Empire and would gladly destroy it. If you ever see the dragons, you should ask them about this. Carefully._
Anaximander says _Perhaps you are taking a little more time to explore the surface than you should. Remember ... time is wasting, and events may be progressing up there in a way we don't like._
Anaximander looks very concerned. _You really should go to the surface as soon as possible. The mages have been scrying and forecasting, and it is clear that, if you wait too much longer, we may not be able to live on the surface. Ever._
_You have done well. You should go to the Portal Fortress, and from there to the Tower of Magi to receive a reward. Once down there, see 'X' and Solberg, and one of them will give you magical training._
Anaximander says _By the way, if you ever have excess items that need storage, leave them in the small storeroom where you found your supplies, or in your quarters to the northeast. I'll make sure nobody disturbs them._
Anaximander says, _By the way, we have something for you. Time is of the essence, and you have much distance to travel._ He hands you an amulet. _Using this when outdoors will return you to Fort Emergence._
_Certain of our agents report that there is a way, on the surface, due north of Fort Emergence, to teleport to different places on the surface. Investigate this ... between that and the amulet, you will be able to travel anywhere quickly._
_You have done very well. Go speak with 'X' and Solberg - one of them will give you magical training. They're skulking about in this fort somewhere._
You tell Anaximander of the crystal shards you recovered from below the hill giant and troglodyte lairs. _Crystals, eh? The Vahnatai use crystals in their magic, and they certainly have no love for the Empire._
_They have been very secretive since the end of the Empire War. Why don't you go visit Ghikra and see what they have to say about these shards._
Anaximander looks relieved to see you. _Welcome back, adventurers. We could use your help. A valuable artifact has been stolen._
Aniximander doesn't look up as you approach - he is studying his papers with unusual intensity. _Welcome back. I need you to go on a little side jaunt. There have been some murders in the north that I really think you should look at._
Anaximander greets you, a terrified expression on your face. _Welcome. I trust you have heard ... the Tower of Magi has fallen to demons. It is desperately important that someone go there and stop them._
Suddenly, without warning, you feel a vicious mental jolt. As your head clears, you feel something horrible has happened, but you haven't the slightest idea what.
The horrible feeling you felt earlier returns, stronger than ever. You hear a voice in your mind, a female voice that sounds strongly familiar. It says, simply, _We are dying. Help us. Oh God, help us._ Then, mercifully, the feeling fades.
You again hear a cacophany of voices, distant and filled with horror. Then one drowns out all the others, a cruel, deep inhuman voice: _We have the Tower, and soon we will have you all. So come defy us. Nothing would make us happier._
A ghostly image appears in front of you. It is Anaximander. He says _Return to Fort Emergence as soon as possible. Drop whatever you're doing. The greatest emergency yet faces us, and we need your help._
Again, the screams from far beneath the Earth come to you, combined with inhuman howls of hunger and triumph. You cannot help but feel that if something is not done soon, something horrible will happen.
Again, the inhuman evil voice comes to you. _I am Grah-Hoth, and I am coming! Soon I will be here, and you will have no home to return to. All Exile will suffice to satisfy my hunger._ He laughs, and fades away.
You have the strongest feeling of horror yet, and deep, overwhelming sense of great evil building. You know that if action is not taken, and very soon, the effects will be truly devastating.
Suddenly, he remembers something and checks his records. _Oh dear. We've been seeing movements around the town of Ghikra for days, but it was the Vahnatai, so we didn't worry. You'd better go check up there._
As you put on the amulet, he says _Oh, I almost forgot! Very, very high mountains can sometimes prevent the amulet from returning you here. Don't worry about it, though ... I'm sure it's a problem you'll never have._
Levy checks some records, counts out a small pile of gold coins, and hands them to you. _You have been budgeted a 25 gold per diem. Here is your allowance for today. Don't spend it all in one temple._
Levy looks over his records, and shakes his head. _Sorry, it seems you've already received your per diem. Come back tomorrow. And spend more carefully next time._
Levy looks through a large book, checks again, and looks back up apologetically. _Nope, you've done nothing yet to merit a reward. Perhaps you should do some adventuring and check later._
Levy looks through a large book, finds something of interest, and produces a potion from under the counter. _Well done! Here is the reward for dispatching the Alien Slime._
Levy looks through a large book, finds something of interest, and smiles unctuously at you. _For squishing those roaches, you get something._ He hands you a small gold ring from behind the counter.
Levy looks through a large book, finds something of interest, and says _Not bad! Those trogs and giants must have been tough. I'm sure this will make up for the trouble._ He gives you a necklace from behind the counter.
Levy looks through a large book, finds something of interest, and looks at you with surprise. _You beat the golems! We were betting you couldn't. Here's a reward ..._ He disappears under the counter for quite a while, and comes up with some boots.zElisa purses her lips. _Now dears, don't be too greedy! A lot of people need food besides yourselves! Come back tomorrow._
Elisa smiles maternally. _Oh, you poor dears. You need some lunches? Just a moment._ She sets to work, and soon comes back with several neatly wrapped bundles of rations. _Here you are! Now be careful out there!_
You describe to Berra the rune you found in the Alien Slime's lair. He looks highly disturbed. _I know that. That is the rune of Erika the Archmage. Perhaps you should go speak to Anaximander ... this is dire news._
You show Berra the odd scales you found in the cockroach lair. _This is pathetically obvious. These are dragon scales. Where did you get them?_ You tell him, and a looks alarmed. _You should tell Anaximander of this immediately._
You give Berra the crystal shards from the caves below the giant fortress. He moves off to test them, then returns. _Well, it's not conclusive, but the Vahnatai are the true masters of magic using crystals. This may have been made by them._
Mazumdar thinks, and then slowly shakes her head. _I'm sorry, but it is too much of a risk to say more. If certain things were known, it would cause us great trouble._
Mazumdar thinks. _It seems you are now important enough that I should help you if I can. We have, hidden in a secret passage nearby, spellbooks with several spells. They are guarded by a magic barrier._
Solberg shakes his head. _I'm sorry, but we only give the more powerful spells to those who have need of them. After the disasters of the past, we know we must be careful with access to magic._
Solberg nods. _Your struggle against the Alien Slime shows you'll need more powerful magic to complete your surface task._ He teaches you the spells Ice Bolt and Venom Arrows.
Solberg says _Considering your efforts against the cockroaches, giving you more spells is a wise investment._ He teaches you the spells Firestorm and Summoning.qThe whispering voice emerges from the hood. _I will teach you no powerful mage spells. You have not earned them._
_You have done well. You have earned more magic. Listen carefully._ He tells you, in a terse way, how to cast Daemon and Mindduel.
_We heard of your fight with the golems. We will teach you magic now, from the highest circle. Use it wisely._ He teaches you the spells Shockwave and Protection.
_Two New Formellans, Thompson and Foley, recently went north to a small cave to look for minerals. Days later, there was a quake. Then the bodies were found. Their bodies are there still - nobody wants to go and get them._
You describe the rubble and the key you found. Flanagan is thoughtful. _Well, it's clear we've stumbled onto something big here. I'll stay here and keep investigating. Thanks for your help. Now go to Anaximander to report._
Flanagan shrugs. _I don't think there's much to do. We know someone very powerful was up north, and probably fried Foley and Thompson. Be sure to tell Anaximander what you found._
She teaches you a short spell. _Use this to pass the barrier. Please, don't tell anyone of the spells we have here. If you did, we'd lose them._
_Go up and investigate. Find what you can of who killed them, and, if you can, find the killers. I'll wait here. Report to me when you find something._dHe grunts in irritation. _What evidence do you have? None? I thought as much. Quit wasting my time._VHe shakes his withered head in worry and confusion. _Go see Anaximander. Immediately._
,_Not sure what you're talking about. Sorry._
She checks her journal and shakes her head. _Sorry. You have no official business down below, so I can't let you use the portal. Maybe you could go back down if you show Anaximander you've done something impressive._
She checks her journal. _It says here you're authorized to go down below and receive magical instruction. Go ahead and use the portal when you want, but please, don't overuse your privilege._
She looks ill. _I'd give you permission, if there was something for the portal to connect to. It'll be months before the Tower of Magi gets restored to the point where the portal there can be activated. It's bad news. For all of us._
She checks her journal. _Ah, yes! You were the ones who were going to be sent to recover Thralni's Sphere. I know some stuff about the Sphere, and the portal will take you to the area where it's located. The approximate area, that is._
She perks up. _Wait! I've heard of you! Can you get to the Tower? If you can bring me back my amulet from the Tower of Magi, I'll make it worth your while!_
_Have you seen my amulet?_ You give it to her. _Great!_, she says, and give you a scroll in return. _That's a good scroll, but my amulet is worth infinitely more. Now I go on to my post!_ She puts it on, and her face resumes its former dour expression.?_What? You gave the amulet to me already! What's your problem?_
She looks grim. _I should hope you want to go down. The Tower of Magi is sealed off. This teleporter is the only route in. Go down there, and retake the place, or we're all doomed. Good luck to you!_
_Recently, a courier carrying a crystal statue I had made was slain by bandits and the statue stolen. Yet another theft by humans. If you can recover it and bring it to me, I will reward you with another of my crystals._
He looks pleased. _Again, humans correct the wrongs of humans! And in reward ..._ He produces a beautiful, carved pink crystal. _It is a Soul Crystal, using for certain magical spells, and it is yours!_ He gives it to you.m_Thank you again for being returning it to me. It goes a bit of a way to making me not mistrust humans more._
_Yes, that is our purpose now. We wait until someone finds who made the plagues of monsters on the surface, so that we can craft a weapon to use against them._
_Should you ever know who created the monsters, come back and tell me their name so we can make a weapon. One warning, however._
_Erika is responsible for the attacks on the surface? Sad and worrying, but understandable. If it is necessary to battle her to regain our homeland, however, it is necessary._
_The Vahnatai have caused the horrors on the surface? Disturbing news indeed ... their magic is easily equal to our own. Perhaps, however, we may find a way to disrupt the crystals they use for their magic._
_Dragons, eh? They are strong and wise, but not invulnerable. Humans have slain two of them so far. We will see what we can do to make the task a little easier._
_We will focus all of our energies on finding a way to fight this foe. Return here in a few days, and we should have something for you._
_Erika is known to us to often rely of magical firetraps to fend off her foes. They are her main defense. We have created a series of amulets which will provide all of you with protection from fire of all sorts, and especially hers._
_The Vahnatai create intelligent beings in crystal form. We've done the same. We've made a slightly sentient crystal which may be able to interfere with their crystals. We aren't sure if it will work, but it might._
_We have made a magical sword. It can deliver devastating blows to all beings with reptilian blood, including, in fact especially, drakes and dragons. Be careful not to misplace it._u_Look for this device in the chest in the next room. We hope you can justify the horrible price we have paid for it._
Ostoth looks very grim. _We have made a magical device for you, but at great cost. Both Pathass and Enla put too much of their energy into it. Pathass is dead. Enla has left to try to recover._q_Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. We have crafted a tool for you to use. Would you like a description?_
Ostoth shakes his head. _Be patient! Powerful magic is not made overnight, and we are working dangerously fast as it is! Come back tomorrow._
_To the southwest somewhere is a big ice pudding, which has been eating some people traveling up this ways. As I mayor, I really should do something about this. Kill the thing, and I'll pay you well._
You tell Crisper how you slew the ice pudding. _Well done! Thanks for taking care of that!_ He counts you out a generous stack of silver coins. _Now get out there and kill other bad things!_THe shrugs. _Nothing for you to do for me now. But thanks for offering! Want a beer?_AHe grunts and spits. _Yeah? You'll buy my boat? With what money?_aHe grunts and spits. Then he takes your money. _The boat's around here somewhere. Help yourself._kHe grunts and spits. _Oh yeah? What boat? I don't got one left! Ya' think they grow on trees or somethin'?_
_Don't have any romantic ideas about friendly, happy creatures. When we got out here, we found a bunch of them, and they're nasty, vicious pests. The Empire told me to hire someone to get rid of them._
y_So, tell you what. Every unicorn horn you bring me, I give you ten gold. Just come back and tell me you have the horns._
_Well, I'm giving ten gold for every one of those pest's horns I'm brought. You have any?_ You show him your bunch, and collect your gold. _Thanks! Be sure to bring more. It brings meaning to my life, believe me._
_We don't know who is creating the slimes or why, and we don't know where they come from. Perhaps a small, skilled band, such as yours, could have luck finding them._x_Find out where the slimes are coming from, and remove the source, and you will be rewarded lavishly. Good luck to you._
You report what you've found. He shakes his head. _You still haven't eliminated the true source of all the slimes. Keep searching._
You tell Arbuckle of the slaying of the Alien Slime. _Excellent!_ He claps his hands, and a huge sack of gold is brought to you. _I know not your opinion of the Empire, but know this ..._
_By slaying the beast, you saved many innocent lives. Also, I will let news of your brave deed spread. If I have my way, you will be greeted with open arms everywhere in Valorim._
He shakes his head. _Nothing is left for you to do here. The rebuilding is our task. I have sent word of your deed to the other cities of Valorim. Your greeting will not be unfriendly._
He grins. _Well, I need those 'ol chargers a lot, but not so much that I couldn't spare them for a band of adventurers. They're only 1000 gold. A bit steep, but there's a shortage at the moment. Let me know when you'd like to make the purchase._]He frowns. _The price is 1000 gold. The slimes have ate all the other horses in these parts._
He counts the cash and grins. _The horses are yours. They're in the northwest corner of town. Pleasure doin' business with ya!_PHe shakes his head. _No go. You got all the horses I had. I'm a pedestrian now._
_Delis is the home to all manner of pirate scum! I know for a fact that one of them took a package of herbs from a ship coming from the north, and that it's hidden in a back room in the inn there._ (You take note of this.)p_I'd reward well someone who brought that package to me. Just be careful ... those parasites protect their own._
You present Paulo's herbs to him. _Did you have any trouble?_ You tell him what happened. _Oh, too bad. Well, your reward is well earned._ 
He pulls out a small prayer book and explains how to cast Summon Spirit and Charm Foe. _If you forget how to cast them, come back, and I'll teach you again._
i_Ah, yes. The herbs were very useful._ As promised, he reteaches how to cast Summon Spirit and Charm Foe.
The ghost quickly recites the instructions to cast the spell Move Mountains. _There,_ it says. _My work is done. I expect I can move on soon._
_The surface is in turmoil, and it falls to you to forge us a place in the confusion. I wish to aid you. I can track your progress, and provide you aid when need be._
_To do so, you must wear one of my special amulets. Leave to the west, and enter the fourth room on the left. Get the amulet there and bring it to me. And stay out of the other rooms - they aren't safe._i_Before I can help you, you need to bring that amulet to me. Leave to the west, fourth door on the left._
She grins, an unnerving sight at best. _Excellent!_ She immediately begins to cast a long, involved spell. The amulet glows, and sparks fly. Her chanting increases in intensity, and then ends.
_I can now chart your progress wherever you go, and can aid you when your straits are most dire. The amulet can only be removed by extremely strong magic. Now go, and good luck to you._
She waves a hand, and the amulet disintegrates. She looks at you with contempt. _Fine. You spurn my aid, my aid you shall not have. Off with you._
_You still have my amulet. Do not worry. When you need my help, I will try to aid you. Bear in mind, however, that the distance is often great. I cannot guarantee my assistance._
_You decided you didn't want my amulet. You spurned my help. I will not give you a chance to spurn it again. I wish you the best of luck in your efforts, but you must continue alone._
_I have concealed several pieces of metal nearby. I wish it brought to me. It is not too valuable to most, but has uses for my work. If you will bring it to me, I will reward you._
_To the north on the east side of the river are several trees in a diamond shape. The metal is hidden in the hills due north of the center of the diamond. Please bring it to me._
You present the metal to him. He takes it gladly. _Did you have any trouble?_ you tell him about the ambush. He seems troubled. _Oh dear. I'd better stay hidden here for a while then._
_Now for your reward. Nowadays, little is more useful than spells, especially with the monsters about._ He teaches you the spells Summon Beast and Conflagration.
_I have all of the metal I need. Thank you again for your help. Are the spells working out for you?_ He explains the spells again for those of you who don't know them.ZThe Anama member nods approvingly. You have the feeling that what you said has been noted.
rYou receive a disapproving, and slightly disappointed look. You suspect that what you said has been taken note of.
_Actually, I have already shared my views of the Anama beliefs with you. Perhaps if you found an Anama priest or mother in another town, they could share their views with you too._
He is pleased. _We might be convinced to allow you to join our church. There are more benefits to this than you might think for those such as yourselves._
_First, you should learn of our beliefs. Travel the Isle of Bigail. Speak to Anama priests. Learn how we think. When you think you've learned enough, return, and perhaps you may be able to join._
Ahonar shakes his head sadly. _I have spoken with my priests, and it is clear you would not fit in with our faith. The reliance on magic permeates you too deeply. I am sorry. I wish you luck, nonetheless. You may still have a glorious future._{Ahonar smiles. _Your devotion is highly commendable, but you already are one of the Anama. There is no need to join again._pAhonar looks at you darkly. _You left us. You may not rejoin. Once our trust is lost, it may never be regained._
Ahonar looks down at your Anama rings, and suddenly grows furious. _Those rings are the symbols of our faith! How dare you profane them?_
He waves his hands, and the rings turn very hot, and then crumble into dust. _Our struggles are great enough, without the insult of impersonators. I am very disappointed in you._ He calms down a bit.
_One bit of authority remains to me. The Empire gave me the ability to give adventurers a quest, if necessary. Here it is. Slay the cockroaches. Rid the island of them. Save these people, before diseases kill them all._
She coughs delicately into her hand. _Do this, and return to me, and I will reward you well. Please hurry, and good luck to you._
_The source of the roaches has still not been found. Forge onward. Speak with the people of Shayder. It is possible that some of them may have insights into the source of the insect hordes._
You report your deed to Bernathy, and she smiles. _We're safe at last. You've done us a great kindness._ She takes a ring from her pouch and gives it to you. _I own few things now. This is the best. Wear it proudly._
She coughs and shivers. _Much remains to be done. Perhaps we can start to work with the Anama. Thank you again, and good luck to you._
_I have nothing further to ask of you. The remains tasks are ours. We are also trying to find out who could have created such a horrible place and visited such death upon us. We have no clues yet, but the search has begun._s_You already have one of our packages. Deliver that one to Kendra in Lorelei, and we can discuss further packages._
He grins. _Excellent! Another courier!_ He takes a pull from his beer, and continues. _One of the lesser known crops of this isle is a certain herb, which, when chewed, provides great release from the suffering of life._
_There is a package of this herb in a chest in a room to the south. Get it, and take it to Kendra, in the city of Lorelei, and you will be well rewarded._
_As I said, the package is in a chest to the south. Take is to Kendra in Lorelei, and you will be rewarded._ He thinks. _Oh! I forgot! The stuff is illegal. You may not want to get too close to any troops. Just so you know._YAhonar looks disappointed. _I'm sorry you decline. Still, the offer remains open to you._aThe ritual concludes. Ahonar looks very pleased. _Be sure to go upstairs. Much awaits you there._
_Before I tell you, you need to help us. Directly northwest of here, in the middle of a circle of stone, is a big roach lair. Go there and some of my spiders will meet you. Help them kill the bad roaches, and I'll tell you where the nice ones are!_WChief Spider bounces happily. _Well done! You helped us get lots of yummy, yummy food!_
The chief sounds disappointed in you. _You didn't help us much at all. Usually you humans are tougher and better and stuff. I'll tell you where to go, but only so you'll go away._
_The roach lair is directly straight north of here, hidden in the middle of a bunch of trees._ (You take note of this.) _Be nice to them, because they are really friendly and good._
Purgatos ask you where the Filth Factory is. You haven't the foggiest idea. He says _When you find out, return, and the device is yours._
Purgatos hands you a reddish egg-shaped crystal. _It's called a Phoenix Egg, a very rare artifact. Take it to the lowest, most central level of the factory, break it, and run. Fast. And good luck to you._jHe shakes his head. _You got the only one I was able to make. Wish I could help more, but, well, I can't._
_Our mine is to the northeast, but it has been taken over by a band of strange lizard people. They are led by a chieftain, who wields a huge spear, and commands several lizard mages._a_Slay the lizard people's chief, and drive the rest out of the mine, and I will reward you well._p_The job is the same as before. Kill the chief of the lizard people. A mighty sack of gold will be your reward._
You report your deed. After grilling you on the details, Delenn has an assistant fetch you an impressive sack of pure gold nuggets. _Well done, travelers. Now, if you're interested, there's an even more lucrative mission for you._
_If you go through the Golddale mines and emerge at the other end, you'll be in a rocky valley infested with the ursagi. At the east end of this valley is the largest nest of them. They live in caves that also happen to be filthy with gold deposits._IShe grins. _Clean this cavern of monsters, and a magical sword is yours._
She shakes her head. _I send scouts out there all the time. There are still ursagi in those caves, east from the east entrance of the Golddale mines. Kill a few more._
She laughs in glee. _You did it! They've abandoned the cave!_ She pulls a beautiful broadsword, pommel wrapped in leather and with a ruby at the end, out from under her desk. _This is yours!_ She hands it to you.
_I wish I had another job to give to one of your skills. Alas, all I have need of are people with strong backs to do my digging. I wish you the best of luck._
She describes a book to you. _There is a mage named Ernest, Valorim's leading master of teleportation. He lives in a hut southwest of Farport. I can guarantee that book is somewhere inside._X_Get that book and bring it to me, and I will teach you how to cast the spell Identify._
You present the book to her. She flips through it, and makes sure it's genuine and intact. When she's satisfied, she pulls out a spell book.
She teaches you how to cast the spell Identify. It's a short, but intricate and demanding spell. When she's done, she says _That's all I need from you. Thank you._-She shakes her head. _I have no need of you._
He takes your packages of herbs, and pays you 100 gold for each package. It's an easy profit. _Good job, kids,_ he says. _If I had a hundred like you, I'd have it made! Now get back up there!_
Unfortunately, you don't have any herbs to sell him. He says _Squiggus is along the east coast, a few hundred miles up. Get up there, kids! Lots of money to be made!_
_Correct! I return, I shall tell you this ... proceed on the path with the large stone at the entrance. Otherwise, you'll get beaten on._
_7890!_ says the gremlin excitedly. It points at the path with the large rock at the beginning. _5678! 5678!_ It looks pleased that it's been so helpful.
_Excellent!_ Vahkohs roars! He claps is hands and disappears. You hear the roaring of many undead, joyously released to attack you.
Levy checks his records. _Ah! You expelled the demons from the Tower of Magi, possibly saving all of Exile. For that, you get a shield._ He hands you a shield.
_Recently, a troglo envoy came to our walls, bearing a scroll. The envoy shouted that the King of the Troglodytes wished for us to send diplomats to him. It left the scroll and fled._
_Since then, we have been unable to find anyone both skilled and smart enough to  deserve the mission, and suicidal enough to take it. I will reward you. Alas, there is a problem._
He shakes his head. _The problem remains. You have not received permission from Commander Corie. No required permission, no scroll, and no reward._
He shakes his head. _The problem remains. You have not received permission from Internal Affairs. Speak with Levin. No required permission, no scroll, and no reward._
He nods. _Permission has been attained. Well done._ He gives you a battered leather scroll. _Go speak with the King of the Troglos, and bring proof you have spoken with him, and the reward will be yours._
_Well, have you spoken with the trog king yet?_ You are unable to provide any proof that you have. _Well go on over there then! Castle Troglo is northeast of Aminro. I'm counting on you!_
You present the message the Troglo King gave you. The mayor looks at it, and frowns. _What trickery is this?_ He shows you the scroll. It simply says _We will defeat you! - King Vothkaro._
Mayor Knight crumples it up. _Troglos. I'll never understand them. Well done, at any rate. The Dispel Barrier tome is in the City Hall library. Help yourself._
He shakes his head. _Help yourself to the Dispel Barrier tome. I as yet have no need for you. I suggest heading north to Lorelei now. You may be able to help them with their giant problem._fShe laughs. _Sure! We're going to trust likely subversive outsiders with a key mission! Just go away!_
She frowns. _I can't believe Mayor Knight wants to give you this mission. You want permission? Prove your worth. The troglos have a giant altar in the hills east of Angel's Rest._
_Find and destroy it, and permission is yours. The problem is ... it's sure to be magical. You may need a Ritual of Sanctification._
She smiles. _I have to hand it to you. You've done us a great service. Maybe Mayor Knight chose well after all. I've already sent my permission to him. Good luck to you!_?_I've given permission. There's nothing more I can do for you._uHe grins. _If you want the mission, you should speak to Mayor Knight. See you soon!_ You don't like his smile at all.
_So you want permission to go on a mission, eh? Well, it's no problem. However, there's a lot of paperwork that I'll need to fill out first. And there's a filing fee for those papers._
p_Give me 1000 gold, and I'll give you permission. When you have the money, just ask me about the mission again._
Grumbling, you pay the bribe. He accepts it gladly, writes something on a piece of parchment, and gives it to a flunky to take to Mayor Knight. _My permission is yours. Good luck to you._RHe frowns. _Look, you have my permission, and I'm very busy. Good luck. Good-bye._H_I'm afraid you don't have the proper filing fee. I really must insist._
_I was really interested in Sloan, one of the archers in town. I gave him a ring for luck while fighting the troglos. It was a family heirloom. He lost it! Can you believe it! If someone could get back the ring Sloan lost, I'd be very grateful._F_I liked Sloan, but he lost my ring. I just wish I could get it back._
You give her the ring, and explain what happened. Her face brightens. _Oh, that man! I knew he was shy, but I had no idea! I hope he comes by again. I'll apologize for doubting him. Maybe we can try again._ She blushes.
_Thank you so much! You deserve a reward ..._ She packs a big sack full of food and gives it to you, and gives you each a kiss on the cheek.
She thinks. _Now, I just need to wait for Sloan to build up the courage to come back. I'll be patient. He will in his time. It's his way. And thank you again!_
He looks surprised. _I lost Ginny's ring while fighting some troglos outside the walls at the southwest corner of town._ (You take note of this.) _I couldn't find it again. If only I could, I might have hope with her._
His face brightens. _You found the ring!_ He suddenly looks worried. _Could you take it to her yourself? I'm not ready to face her yet. Thank you! Thank you!_
_I heard you returned her ring. I'm still building up the courage to go see her. Thank you again for finding it! I can't put into words how much I appreciate it!_
_I long for a challenge. I'm desperate for it. If you ever find a piece of truly unusual, exceptional metal, bring it to me. I'll make a sword for you, a truly great sword! I ask only 1000 gold for labor._
He turns furious in but a moment. _Where is the metal I need? How am I supposed to display the full extent of my talents using only your pathetic dross?_
You show him the piece of unusual metal you found. _That would be perfect! For a thousand gold, I will make an awesome sword for you._ When you say you don't have it, he shrieks at you in fury. You back away.
You show him the piece of unusual metal you found. _That would be perfect!_ You pay him 1000 gold. He takes the metal. _Now go away!_ he yells. _Come back much later! I will get to work._ He grins in anticipation, and turns to his anvil.
He spits on your boots. _Fool! Do you think a work of art such as I am making for you can be rushed? Get out! Come back tomorrow! Or the day after!_ you see the unfinished sword nearby. It already looks very impressive.
With a flourish and a grin of pride, Carmine presents the blade. It is truly as impressive as he promised. _The metal you gave me, pure mithral. Wonderful stuff._ He hands the blade over.
_And, if you lose or damage it, I hope you rot and die. That's true art I'm entrusting you with. And if you find any more of that metal, be sure to come back!_
She relieves you of your trade goods, paying you 50 gold for each bundle. _Well done! Now would you like to purchase some herbs, so you don't have to waste the trip back?_
She looks over you goods and shakes her head. _I'm afraid you don't have anything we need. Go down to Libras. There's plenty of goods there._
Slightly skeptical, but not wanting to miss out on the possibility of finding a valuable artifact, you pay Masok the hefty sum. He hands you a very old looking piece of parchment with odd writing on it.
He says _Also, I'm selling this because the thing is way far away. Hundreds of miles to the northwest, far north of the town of Calloc. Good luck finding it._pHe shakes his head. _Two thousand gold is a lot, but this is worth it. We're talking a legendary artifact here._B_Sorry. The scroll was all I had. The quest is in your hands now._
You pay her. _Well, then. Listen close. He said he left the map in Aminro to the north. He said he put it in a hole in a rock face. I'm not sure what he meant, but you might be able to find it. Good luck._DYour lack of 500 gold results in a lot of stony silence from Zamora.^_Already told you what I know. Aminro. Rock face. Cliff face. Something like that. That's it._~You pay Bryk. He says _The stable's around back. One of the groups of horses there is now yours. Take good care of my babies._B_Sorry. You've cleaned me out of horses. And thank you very much!_kHe looks upset. _Not only are you trying to take my babies from me, but you want them for free! Forget it!_
He sighs. _Those humanoids are pests. They bug my solitude. I'll teach you the ritual, but only if you leave._ He explains the Ritual of Sanctification. It's simple, but requires great exertion. Then, when done, he turns away.
Kendra look at you meaningfully. _Do you, perhaps, have something on you that I might be interested in?_ When she sees you don't know what she's talking about, she slouches back into her chair.
Kendra looks you over. _Do you, perhaps, have something that I might be interested in?_ You give her the package. She runs to the wall, opens a cabinet, put the package in, and closes it. After a minute, she opens it again.gIt contains a sack of gold, which she hands to you. _Thanks._ she says. _Care to hear about the guild?_f_Do you have any more little packages for me?_ You say no. _Oh well. Want to go speak with the guild?_xShe reaches under the table and presses something. Then she points at the northwest corner of the room. _Through there._*_The door's already unlocked. Go through._
He suddenly gets very angry. _You don't have the gold! I've killed people who've tried to cheat me like this!_ Then he calms himself down, with difficulty. _I'll let you off for now. They're 2500 gold. Don't mess with me again._
He shakes his head. _Anama rings are rare items. I'm clean out. Perhaps if you killed a few of them?_ He laughs at his little joke.
You pay him a lot of money. He gives you each an Anama ring. You try them on, only to find that they don't come off again. Geoffrey laughs. _No returns!_
He frowns, noting the Anama rings you already wear. Then he laughs. _I was just kidding! Sell the sacred symbols of your faith? I'd never dream of such a thing!_ He watches you carefully as he speaks, wondering if he'll have to kill you.
_The giant's caverns are southeast of here. They've captured several of our soldiers. Also, they've taken many of the personal possessions of those they've slain, items that by right belong to the families._tShe asks to see anything you took from the giants that might have belonged to one of her soldiers. You have nothing.uYou give Bruskrud an item you found in the giant's caverns. She grins. _Excellent! Thank you!_ She pays you 300 gold.
She adds _You haven't freed anyone lately, I'm afraid. Remember - the giants live south of Dellston. They have some of my troops, I'm sure of it._
_Also, a soldier you rescued got back to town. Bravely done. Seems like Exile's doing more for us than the Empire these days._ She pays you 500 gold.
_The Empire is ruled by Empress Prazac. We all know that. What I've found out is that she's here! She's in Blackcrag Fortress, only 200 miles north, come down to personally deal with the monsters._
_She's tough, but fair. If we can speak with her, we may be able to deal with her. Tell Anaximander about this as soon as you can!_ (You take note of this.)
_I've already said, Empress Prazac is near here, in Blackcrag Fortress. We may be able to deal with her directly. Anaximander needs to know about as soon as possible._|_Does Anaximander know Empress Prazac is in Blackcrag Fortress?_ You nod. _Well done. Now get out there and kill something!_q_Free the soldiers from the fort, and bring back the dead's possessions and I will pay you out of my own pocket._
You pay him the 600 gold. _Thank you, mightily thewed warriors. You can take one of the horses in the stables. And treat them well! They're great beasts!_nHe shakes his head. _Beasts as noble as these cannot be discounted. Six hundred gold is the absolute minimum!_
He shakes his head. _You hath cleaned out my stock! Verily, none of the mighty beasts remain. I must raise more, and that will take much time. Good luck finding horses elsewhere. You will have to struggle to find beasts as mighty as mine!_[_I gave him a silver ring, a family heirloom. Oh, what I would give to have it back again!_
You give her the silver ring you found in the shipwreck on Lake Tomor. She throws her arms around your neck in thanks. _At last! I have a memory of him!_ She sits back down, drinking and looking at the ring.
_Thank you for bringing the ring back to me. I still grieve, but it helps me much to have it. Thank you!_ She takes another drink.
_There's no chance of sneaking out through the front gate. Have you found a better way out?_ You shake your head no. _Then come back when you find one and let me know, so I can make a break for it._
_There's no chance of sneaking out through the front gate. Have you found a better way out?_ You describe the hidden, brush-filled exit you found. 
_Excellent! I'm going out. Try to make a ruckus to distract the giants!_ The soldier shakes your hand in thanks and leaves the cell, hoping to sneak out of the caves.
You report your deeds to the mayor. He says _Well, I would have preferred the mission was done like I asked. However, your deeds have certainly been worthy of a reward. You may go to the library and get the Dispel Barrier spell._
Yale looks at you somberly. _With the plagues of monsters, the Empire has neglected us out on the frontier. This policy is bearing bitter fruit ... we are assaulted by monsters - undead and lizards mainly._
_They come from a cavern in the mountains forty or fifty miles to the north. Slay them, and we will reward you as best we can._
_The monsters continue to move down on us from their lair in the mountains to the north. Anything bold adventurers such as yourselves could do would be much appreciated._
You tell Yale of your adventures in the Chasm of Screams and your battle with the nagas. He is intensely grateful. _At last! The Empire has abandoned us, but we aren't without aid. I'll make sure word of your deeds spreads._
_Also, here is a small token of our esteem._ He pulls a helmet out from under the table and gives it to you. _Thank you, and good luck to you._m_Your deeds will be sung of here for years. And, fortunately, we have no more need of you. Good luck to you._
_For months, our crops have been torn up, and our animals have been stolen. We know what's causing it now. One of our farmers was out at midnight, and saw Nephilim around his crops._
_Those foul creatures must be dealt with! Their clan lives in the mountains to the northeast. Deal with them, and we will pay you._
_The stealing of our crops and livestock has not ceased. The Nephilim responsible are in the mountains to the northeast. Stop them, and you will be well rewarded!_
You tell Rabellino of your meeting with the Nephilim, and your battle with the Ursagi. _Wonderful! And indeed, the raids have stopped._ He pays you 500 gold. _Pity you couldn't have killed those stinking Nephilim. Pests, the lot of them._
You tell him about your slaying the Nephilim, and he grows angry. _The raids have not stopped! It is clear you failed to destroy their tribe. You try to cheat us? Get out of my sight!_?_Haven't had any more problems. Thank you again for your help._
_This ruin may be invaluable to us, helping understanding our ancestors and give us incredible new knowledge. We are supposed to report it back to our people, but alas, there are undead inside which are of no use to us._h_Go in there, kill the undead, and find if anything of value to us is in there, and we will reward you._
You tell Bohen-Ihrno what you've found. She grows very excited. _Amazing! This is a true find! Rough Crystal Souls, which we may be able to speak with, and find out of our ancestors._i_Now that we know something here is valuable, it is time for us to report to our people. We must depart._yBohen-Ihrno and Abra join hands, and Bohen casts 'Word of Recall.' In a moment, they are gone. You are alone in the cave.
_Not yet._
You tell Bohen-Ihrno what you've found. She says _That is interesting, but not enough. I feel there may well be something else here of use. This place is too strange to not have anything interesting._
_You have done us great good! As a reward, any other treasure in there is now yours. Also ..._ She teaches you the spell Word of Recall.
_I have a habit of helping humans. It is unpleasant, but necessary. We wish Alien Beasts dead. I will make you a weapon to help slay them. To do this, I need two things: instructions for how to make it, and a bar of special metal._Z_Go to my siblings, Khoth and Athron. They will give you these things. Then return to me._~_I still wish to make you a weapon to slay Alien Beasts, but you do not yet have the things I need - instructions, and metal._
You tell Sulfras how to cast the spell to make the weapon. She looks annoyed. _But did I not tell you to also get the metal from Athron? Go back out, and waste not my time._
You tell Sulfras you found the metal needed to make the weapon. She looks annoyed. _I also need the spell to cast on the finished weapon! See Khoth ... his knowledge of all things is great. Sometimes it is all he is good for._
You give the metal to Sulfras. She mumbles a spell, while dipping it deep in the lava. She pulls it out - it's now a sword! She then casts the spell you learned from Khoth's books.
The spell seems to drain even Sulfras. The sword glows blindingly brightly. She casts a final spell, and it cools. Silently, she hands the blade to you.
Sulfras shakes her head. _You have the blade. It will slay Alien Beasts. That is all I can do for you. They are mostly around the Keep of Tinraya. Good luck to you._
Pasi thinks, and shakes his head. _No, the mayor is paranoid about Exiles. My letting people in is tolerated. If I let an Exile in, though, I'll get my neck stretched._t_But tell you what. Do something that'll make me think you have a chance fighting the golem, and I'd take the risk._
Pasi thinks. _I hear a lot of what goes on. I heard what you accomplished to the south. I'll take the risk of letting you in, though if the mayor finds out I helped an Exile, I'll be in mortal danger._mHe points to the nearby trees. _The passage in is through there. Be wary around City Hall. Good luck to you._
He smiles. _I heard what you did about the golems. Everyone is thankful. The passage into Gale is through those trees. Feel free to go in._
_I already told you, you can go into Gale whenever you want. Just watch out. The guards are dangerous, and have been told to watch out for Exiles._
You pay the 750 gold. _Your horses are in the stable. Just remember ... buying them to save yourselves is an exercise in futility._^_You don't have the 750 gold, but worry not ... all is not lost. Have you heard of the Anama?_X_I have no horses left, but worry not ... all is not lost. Have you heard of the Anama?_sShe sighs. _Alas, I only have the strength now to teach one minor spell._ She teaches you the spell Light Heal All.
You pay the considerable sum. Cerulain mumbles a brief spell. _You can now enter the library proper. Please make sure your fingers are clean before handling the tomes._D_I know it is a lot of gold, but if you won't pay, you can't enter._W_You already can enter. I appreciate your trying to pay extra, but it isn't necessary._
He shakes his head. _Before Prazac will take the risk of dealing with an Exile, you must prove your skill. There are two ways you can do this._
_One, find and destroy the source of the golems. Two, do something to blunt the force of the giants near Lorelei. Do one of these, and you will have earned the right to see Prazac. Return when you have._
He shakes his head and sniffs. _Destroy the golems, or reduce the power of the giants. Until you have done one of these things, you are not useful enough for us to risk dealing with you._
He nods. _We have watched you progress, and you are indeed capable enough for us to risk dealing with you. You may enter._ He claps his hands, and there is a click from the door to the throne room.
She pulls out a scroll and holds it delicately. _This needless conflict between the Empire and Exile, the nation we have created, must end, and end justly._ She hands you the scroll.x_This is a vital diplomatic message for your master, Anaximander. Take it to him with all haste, and then return to me._rShe gives you an icy look. _You have not yet delivered my vital missive. Do so. Then we can discuss other issues._
You give her Anaximander's message. She reads it, and nods. _Excellent. It would seem, as they say, that we have a deal. The key to the whole monster mystery would seem to be Footracer Province, where the alien beasts are imprisoned._U_I grant permission to enter there to investigate. Be careful, and good luck to you._
_You have your permission to enter Footracer Province. Simply go to the gate, and you will be able to enter. That is all the help I can give you, for now. Good luck to you._
MAGIC FOR DUMMIES - |Many people these days are getting into all sorts of spell-casting. No longer is the powerful and lucrative field of magic restricted to only the talented and wise. Now you, yes, even you, can learn spells!
This book will teach you how to cast a variety of cantrips, which will easily perform tasks such as cleaning a floor of dust, cooking a rump roast in moments, or even spaying a cat!
SURFACE FLORA AND FAUNA |   by Eva of the Tower of Magi |Many are the wonders of nature available on the surface of the world. Our long exile has made us forget the beauty that is our birthright, but little by little, we begin to remember.
Although the Empire did its best to cleanse the surface of anything wild or dangerous, and were, as far as we know, successful, many bizarre and fascinating creatures, such as 'birds' and 'clams' and 'bushes' still exist and thrive.
THE TEARING OF THE BODICE |  By E. Sternberg, Esquire |Esmerelda ran through the bushes, barely ahead of her ravening pursuers, her chest heaving mightily to escape the pathetic remaining shreds of her leather armor.
The bizarre, tentacled squirreloid creature pursued close behind, panting and tingling. _Soon, wild maiden!_ he cried. _Soon, you will be MINE!_ |(It continues in this vein for a long, long time.)
WEAPONRY OF THE REALM |Many are the tools of destruction that have been developed for use in melee. These can generally be divided into three groups: pole weapons, bashing weapons, and, most commonly, edged weapons.
Pole weapons, such as spears and halberds, do the most damage, but require two hands to use. Bashing weapons, such as maces and hammers are often less effective, but powerful magic specimens are thought to exist.
THE FURY OF THE NEPHILIM |  Hrrmrrr drew his sword and strode forth from the crude, disgusting mud hut in which the foul feline creature lived with his disgusting brethren. _Now I go forth!_ he cried.
_Now I go, and slay humans, and butcher their children, and interfere with their farm animals foully. For that is my purpose on this Earth. And the Empire shall never get all of us, no matter what they do!_
SECRETS OF TRAINING |Many adventurers struggle long and hard to accumulate experience, only to squander it away, or not even to be able to put it to use at all! It takes gold for training, in addition to experience. Be sure to save!
Buying defensive skill is definitely useful, but to a point. Not even a lot of training in defense will allow one to cast spells while using heavy armor. Also, a little learning in Item Lore isn't very useful. A fair amount is needed to get good effects.
ROACHES AND YOU by Ezzrik of Gale |Even though the Empire has had much success freeing us from the larger pests roaming our fair world, the lowly cockroach has been an opponent able to stand up to our mighty leader's best efforts.
In this book I discuss the strategies and results of our leader's roach elimination plan: Project Mojo. In addition, I give tips to keep these nasty little creatures from setting up shop in your own hovel. First, you will need a torch and some oil...
THE FAITH OF THE ANAMA |  by Ahonar |Magic. It is the life blood of our society. We defend with it, build with it, work with it, rely on it, use it to develop and enrich every aspect of are lives. Or do we?
Magic does some good, but also does much evil. The common nature of magic puts power into the hands of all: the cruel, the deranged, the Exiles. In this book, I explain our faith, which seeks inner peace through the control of this wild power ...
THE LANDS OF THE EMPIRE |The Empire, blessed power over us all, controls the four known continents. Aizo, the oldest, is the birthplace of the Empire, although the ruling seat is now on the continent of Pralgad.
Vantanas is the smallest continent, but in many ways the richest, with its hot climate, fascinating fauna, and rich stores of gold and diamonds. And finally, there is the recently settled Valorim, which has a wild (though controlled) spirit.
The Life of Empress Prazac |by Flotno Boerheis |Our blessed Empress and ruler, Prazac the Kind and Just, was born in Y.E. 5420. Her royal parents, Hawthorne and [censored], waited nearby, anxious and loving.
It is said that angels appeared and the sky opened up in holy light on the eve of her birth. Eyewitness accounts prove this story true in legally enforceable way. This was a great harbinger of the wondrous works she was later to achieve ...
NIGHT OF THE BLOOD FANG |by Q. King, Esq. |Chad Hardslab, who had recently and through many years of brave fighting and hardship, been declared a Dervish of the mighty Empire army, looked out over the veldt.
_Tonight,_ he boomed, _tonight, in a bloody, detailed way, those foul Nephilim scum will pay for killing my mother, father, brother, grandmother, other brother, first love, sister, second love, and teacher! He drew his swords, and strode forth._
Creatures of Legend |The merciful and powerful Empire has ridded the Earth of many sorts of evil, verminous creatures. The foul Dragons, the troglodytes, and soon the Nephilim are all examples of dark forces the Empire has completely wiped out.
This book exists to describe these creatures and their sinister deeds, so that we may never forget the Empire's benevolence. We start with the troglodytes, sinister humanoids who once actually roamed our lands ...
Arrived at Fort Emergence, the fort just beneath the surface of the world. Were given maps of nearby surroundings, and were told to go see Anaximander for instructions.sSaw Anaximander. Was told to go out onto the surface, find out the approximate situation there, return, and report.NEmerged onto surface for the first time. Area looked to be sparsely populated.
DSaw a strange, magical slime creature, of a sort previously unknown.oGot mission from Mayor Arbuckle: go eliminate magical slime creatures that have been ravaging Krizsan Province.
Destroyed magical creature that was creating the magical slimes. Magical slimes disappeared. Alien Slime seemed to have been magically created.NSaw some enormous cockroaches. Creatures seemed to be doing noticeable damage.tDestroyed pit in which the horde of gigantic cockroaches was spawned. Still not sure what could create such a place.
Met our first troglodyte. They're horrible, twisted humanoid creatures. Potentially very dangerous, and not as stupid as they look.
Saw a hill giant. The army of these huge thugs has apparently been totally ravaging the countryside. May be another manifestation of the plagues of monsters.
Broke down barrier separating the troglodytes from the hill giants. Having a natural enmity, the two armies, immediately attacked each other. The surrounding human cities should be safe for a while.
Attacked by a very well-constructed and lethal golem, of unknown origin. Only an intensely powerful source of magic could create these creatures in quantity. 
After a long, dangerous adventure, managed to destroy the crystal that was creating and controlling the golems. Without their master, they became inactive. The countryside is saved.
Saw a bizarre, alien, and lethal beast, unlike any yet encountered. These things are far more dangerous than any other the other monsters plagues we discovered. 
Found out the Empress Prazac was staying in Blackcrag Fortress, and given directions for how to reach her. Perhaps some sort of direct diplomacy may help our peoples settle our differences without further bloodshed.uEncountered Empress Prazac briefly. She gave a message to relay back to Anaximander, and promised aid if we complied.
Got message back to Anaximander. After a time, you were given a new message to take to Empress Prazac: her offer was accepted. If the monster plagues could be ended, the Exiles would be allowed land on the surface.
Returned Anaximander's message to Empress Prazac. She, in turn, told you of the Alien Beast's destruction of the Keep of Tinraya, and gave you permission to enter the quarantined lands around it.
Managed to expel an invasion of demons from the Tower of Magi, saving Exile. Unfortunately, Tower was totally destroyed in the process.
Investigated two murders near New Formello. Murderers were not discovered, but it was clear some sort of highly advanced magic was involved. A key with a peculiar design was found.SRecovered the recently stolen Orb of Thralni from a strange magic-worshipping cult.
Found out that strange symbol found in the lair of the Alien Slime was the symbol of Erika the archmage. Possible evidence of source of the plagues of monsters.
Discovered that dragon scales were present in cockroach pit. Dragons would definitely be powerful enough to create these plagues of monsters, and have the patience to bring the plan to fruition. More investigation is warranted.
Found out that the barrier between the troglodytes and the hill giants was very advanced crystal-based magic. The Vahnatai are the masters of crystal magic ... possible evidence of their involvement in the monster plagues.
Discovered that golems were being created by several mutant Crystal Souls. The monster plagues were definitely being caused by the Vahnatai, probably as continued revenge for the Empire's theft of their Crystal Souls.oReceived mission from Mayor Bernathy of Shayder - destroy the cockroaches that have plagued the Isle of Bigail.%Slew Erika the archmage in her tower.
After many bureaucratic difficulties (and one bribe) received a mission from Mayor Knight of Sharimik - go speak with Vothkaro, the King of the Troglodytes.
Learned that several dragons who once lived in Exile have moved to the surface. Know that they are in the mountains north of the town of Calloc.
Discovered the concealed lair of the dragons Athron, Khoth, and Sulfras.

Given mission by Dervish Bruskrud of the city of Lorelei: rescue as many prisoners and soldier's personal belongings as you can from the cavern of the hill giants.
Completed mission for King Vothkaro of the troglodytes. In return, he told you that the giants own a map made by the troglos. The map would lead you to a place where you can bring down the barrier that separates them, enabling them to fight each other.
You meet a woman with a sun-weathered face, loose clothes, and a sure step. Tattoos ring her arms and wrists. She walks carefully through the ruined streets of the town, constantly scanning the rubble for slimes.
An old, angular man sits behind the counter, banging some dents out of a breastplate. He wears a huge breastplate and greaves. You wonder how he can even stand up.
You meet a captain of the Empire army. He has a squished, puffy face and a huge nose. His armor has several acid scars on it. Looks like he's had a run-in with a slime recently.
You meet an officious looking woman carrying a double armload of notebooks, scrolls, and other records. Every once in a while, she stops at the side of the street and shuffles through them.
You meet a small, fidgety man with the look of a natural-born bureaucrat. He sits in an impressive polished oak chair far too large for him. He looks truly wrecked, as if he hasn't slept for days, and constantly look under and behind the chair.__Ah, you're back!_ Erika says. _Do you have the amulet?_ She sees you don't, and looks annoyed.
_Ah, you're back!_ Erika says. _Do you have the amulet?_ You show it to her. _Excellent. Now, the question is: do you wish me to activate it?_

You meet a young mage. She look extremely nervous, however, and checks you fastidiously for boils and other signs of communicable disease. When you seem clear, she calms down, but still goes nowhere near you.\You meet a tall sailor, who seems resigned to pacing back and forth restlessly by the docks.

Alchemy and Poison
Alchemy can be incredibly useful. Potions can give you the added boost you may need to get through a long grueling dungeon, and you cannot raise the dead without the right concoction.
You need three things to make a potion:|1. High alchemy skill. When a character tries to make a potion, his/her alchemy skill must be above a certain level. The higher above that level, the better the chance for success.
2. The right ingredient. Ingredients are usually found at special encounters outdoors, and regenerate themselves after a time. Generally, the person who teaches a recipe tells you what plant it needs.m3. The recipe. These are usually bought in towns. You only need to buy each recipe once for the entire party.
When you have all these things, go into a town and click on the blue bottle button. Pick the PC with the highest alchemy skill to make the potion. Hope.
Here is a list of the alchemical concoctions, with min. skill to make: |Weak Curing |  Min. Skill - 1 |Need holly. Cures poison somewhat.JWeak Healing |  Min. Skill - 1 |Need comfrey root.

Restores a fair amount of spell points.
Knowledge Brew |  Min. Skill - 19 |Legend says it is possible to make this incredibly potent concoction. However, the secret has been long lost.vOne of the most useful things you can make with alchemy is poison, a powerful weapon in the magic-poor world of Exile.
Many monsters are immune to magic and fire. However, not many are poison-resistant. This makes poison an excellent mage-killer.
To poison a weapon, use it during combat. Your hand-to-hand weapon (the first one, if two are equipped) or arrows will become poisoned. Each time you attack, the level of poison decreases.
Don't poison a weapon too long before combat. It's effectiveness decreases with time. Also, switching weapons makes the poison disappear.
Poisoning an already poisoned weapon doesn't do much good. The weapon gets the maximum poison level of the poison being added or the poison already there, no more.
You gently slide the drawer open. You notice two things simultaneously. First, that the drawer is empty, and second, that the rune is beginning to glow red. The rune immediately explodes.
This is the inn's common room ... a room filled with beds where those with little cash can flop for the night. The unpleasant smell and the insects that run for cover when you enter indicate that perhaps these aren't the highest quality lodgings.
Someone had ambitious plans for this room. New tiles are set in the floor in a beautiful, intricate pattern. That is, however, as far as the construction went. The slimes must have scared them off.pYou find a small bedroll and a cooking pot. It looks like someone is in the habit of sleeping here occasionally.
Someone has found a nice secluded niche in the city walls, and fashioned a concealed tunnel into it. The area has the stink of illegality about it.
You have found a concealed tunnel in and out of Krizsan. Not surprising. What city would be complete without a way for unsavory types to slip in and out?
This room has fallen victim to a slime attack. They simply dissolved their way through the wall, ate anything organic, and melted everything else with acid.
You find a body, mostly dissolved by the slimes. No recognizable features remain. You see half of a wooden ankh lying on the ground nearby. 
The common room of the inn is filthy, bug-infested, and filled with a thick miasma of human stench. As if that wasn't enough, there is also the vague undertone of sour slime smell in the air, and the walls look partially dissolved in places.sYou find the body of an archer. It looks like he was picked off by a barrage of Spark spells from a distance. Ugly.
You smell sulphur, and small sparks fly from the ground. As you back away, you hear a soft voice say, _Anama members only in this area. Please back away. Thank you for your cooperation._LYour Anama rings glow briefly. Your skin tingles. Nothing else happens. Odd.
The bookshelf is filled with musing and notebooks on esoteric elements of Anama religious theory. It's probably all very interesting to someone who isn't you.
You pay the ten gold and hop on the ferry. Except for the crew finding and killing a few giant roaches, the trip is uneventful. Within a day, you have landed at the crude wooden docks of Marish.PYou don't have the ten gold. The sailors laugh at you, and send you on your way.
The Anama temple library contains, surprise, surprise, an incredible variety of religious tracts. There are pamphlets on all manner of Anama theory, from the horrible things caused by magical spells, to ways to live comfortably without them.
You have found a section of Shayder, that, for some reason, was walled off and abandoned. The walls are crumbling and clearly substandard. These are probably the remains of an older part of town, abandoned and walled off for safety's sake.CYou put a few coins in the tithe box. Nothing happens, good or bad.GYou leave the tithing box behind. You fail to suffer divine punishment.
You pick up the package. It's small, and filled with some sort of densely packed leaves. The package has an odd, musty smell. You bury it deep within your pack, and move on.
This was a horrible, horrible mistake. You're way out of your league here, especially considering that the altar is already sanctified. The energy deep within the stone lashes out and bakes you to a crispy golden brown. 1You kneel and pray. The altar seems unimpressed. 
You break into these cramped, ill-smelling living quarters. Among the dirty clothes and bits of trash, you see several extremely unsavory looking characters. They react to your breaking into their home with annoyance.
These must be sailors' quarters. Only sailors are generally capable of making living quarters so cramped, grit-encrusted, and smelly.
The Empire requires the bureaucrats of Shayder to fill out many forms. Once they're filled up, they end up here. It's hard to imagine them being useful to anyone, let alone you.
This building was used for something recently. It has only just been cleaned out. There are only a few bits of litter left behind. There's also an odd smell.
You kneel and pray, and bask in the warm energy of the altar. A tingling feeling flows up and down your veins. Your Anama rings glow briefly. You feel energized.
You see some bits of odd, brown stuff on the grass, and bend down to investigate. There are roach droppings, and a bit of shedded shell. There's also a 2 foot long antennae. Not the sort of litter one enjoys finding in a town.
A note on the counter  reads: _To my customers. As much as I have enjoyed serving you, the disease and stress have been too much to handle. I have returned to the mainland. Thank you for your custom, and good luck to you! - Renton_IThis home has been recently abandoned. Score another one for the roaches.
You suddenly feel wracking pains across your stomach and chest. The agony is  sufficiently intense to double you over. After a few minutes the worst of the pain passes, but you still feel very ill.
UA note tacked to the door to the east reads _Closed due to quarantine. Do not enter._
This is the Shayder city hall. However, it seems to have been abandoned. Dust covers everything, and the forms on the table are starting to yellow.
Piles of white powder have been placed on the ground in this alley. There are dead roaches near each pile of powder. This stuff is something the Isle of Bigail could probably use a lot more of.
A note on the wall reads: _To all concerned: Lockhart passed away, after a brief but valiant struggle with his illness. Condolences may be passed to his family. Speak with Ahonar for details. Lockhart will be missed._
The Shayder Bazaar has been abandoned and cleaned out. The smell of rot and disease hangs exceptionally heavy in here. It's kind of creepy. 
A huge fire burns in this chamber, kept active to incinerate items and bodies infected by the roach plague. It's a horrid and effective testimonial to the extent of the plague. The oily smoke coats everything nearby, including the insides of your throats._You dig up the box, brush the dust off, and open it. It contains a bunch of shiny silver coins!]You start to feel very ill. There's a lot of nausea, and bits of your hair start falling out.
You find the body of a guard who had the misfortune of being caught outside the walls. Most of his body and everything he carried have been dissolved.
This is very odd! You tried to land in the middle of town, but a breeze blew you over here. Must be some sort of a weird magical defense.zYou find the tunnel the troglodytes dug to get into the town. They collapsed it before entering. You can't follow it back.zYou take the boat ride. Eight tedious and seasickness-punctuated hours later, you find yourselves at the docks of Farport.
You reach the end of the dock, where swarthy sailors prepare a boat which will soon carry passengers to Farport. As you don't have a ticket, you can't ride with them. They tell you you can get tickets from Kurt.
This room is filled with piles of jumbled armor components. Chain links are scattered about, waiting to be made into armor. It looks like someone is trying to run an armor shop from here. A sign on the door reads _Warning! Magical trap!_
You open the dresser. A magical trap is activated! A scream erupts, so loud it causes the walls of the inn to vibrate! Guards immediately start moving in.dYou start to step into Spragin's bedroom, but he says _Excuse me! Don't go in there!_ You back away.
This was once an armory, before several fireballs blew it to bits. The anvil and firepit still remain, and bits of metal are scattered throughout.
You break into Sharimik's treasury, and, surprise, surprise, an alarm sounds out. Looks like you're about to have a very long day.
Fireballs explode!
Sharimik is the center for a very wide range of military operations. It is thus inevitable that a large amount of paperwork is generated here. It's all stored in this room, where it decays and is eventually forgotten.
This door is covered with very powerful runes of locking. Even if you could get it open, you have little doubt all manner of alarms would sound out. You back away.
This door is covered with very powerful runes of locking. Fortunately, when you get close, you hear a click. The door recognizes you and unlocks itself.
You are underneath one of Sharimik's towers. You climb the ladder and poke your head inside. There are several guards, watching for troglodytes. One of them tells you, in a very obscene manner, to get out. You oblige.
This hastily erected building is where the troglodytes Sharimik soldiers capture waste away while awaiting torture and execution. The smell of rotting garbage and rotting prisoners makes you feel ill.
This store has been abandoned. The multitude of blood stains behind the counter indicate that the owner of the store did not leave peacefully. It's a grisly sight.
You read the tome, and find, laid out in a plain and concise manner, the instructions for casting the spell Dispel Barrier. Excellent!]A tiny rune on the floor flashes brightly. A cloud of noxious gas billows out of the dresser!
You are standing at the entrance to Hawke's Manse, a massive, stately mansion at the northwest corner of Lorelei. Its basalt, gargoyle-adorned spires tower over you. It's a beautiful, but imposing place.
It's also off limits. The door is very locked, and the windows are covered. There's a sign hung on the doorknob: 'For Sale. Interested buyers should contact Lyle, at Internal Affairs.'
As you enter the temple, you feel an unpleasant, tingling sensation all over your bodies. Then an invisible force wall throws you back. An atonal, disembodied voice says _Anama members only._ So much for that.
As you enter the temple, you feel a pleasant, tingling sensation all over your bodies. An atonal, disembodied voice says _Welcome, members of the faith._
A large, dark mansion occupies the northwest corner of town. It was built to last ... the giants' bombardment has barely affected it. The courtyard has a very pleasant little garden.
This is the guards' bookshelf. The books are evenly divided between books on tactics and fighting techniques, picture books, and books intended for a very adult audience.GYou find a hole in the ground. Somebody dug something up here recently.
\These rooms were someone's home. Whoever lived here had the relative good sense to move out.
This is interesting. This room is set up like someone's home. However, everything is pristinely arranged and covered with a thin layer of dust. It's more like a museum display of a home than an actual home.
You hear a man's hoarse laugh. It comes from nearby, but you're not sure where. The voice says, in between chuckles, _If you weren't Exiles, you'd be dead now! Be more alert! And come in!_ You aren't sure what he's talking about.
You mention to Anaximander you reached Lorelei. He nods, and thinks. _You know, we have an agent there. His cover name is Dwaine. Be sure to look for him. He'll probably be in hiding. It's his way._
You find the body of a female beggar. She died quickly ... one shattering blast from a giant's club. At least it wasn't disease or acid.
Unfortunately for Lorelei, a patrol of giants has just snuck into this ruined corner of town. Unfortunately for you, you've just run into them.
You find a note, pinned to the table with a knife: _Giants too much for me. Gone to Dorngas. Anyone wanting to study Alchemy can find me there. - Carlos_
You enter the ruins of Lorelei's park. The giants breached the wall in this corner of town, and the Lorelei militia sealed it off with force barriers and stone walls. Unfortunately, the giants left a small force here ...
Unfortunately, this gate has been shut off from the rest of town. The giant's decimation of the northeast corner of town has reached here. You may want to reenter town from another direction.
He looks at you dubiously when you tell him you joined the Anama. _Well, it is acceptance from surface people. I hope you know what you're doing. Also, if you ever want to quit, I'm sure studying Mage Spells again will get them to kick you out._nA group of Lorelei soldiers, growing increasingly irritated with you, march up to throw you out of town again.
You approach the city of Gale's massive, closed steel gates. Used to the open gates of Valorim's other cities, you stand patiently, waiting for them to open and let you into the grim streets beyond.
You wait to no avail. After a few minutes, a guard walks up to the gate, laughs at you, and says _Go away! The city is closed to visitors! Go elsewhere!_ Then he walks away, leaving you stuck outside.
You walk up to the small side gate, placed here for foot traffic to enter the city quickly. However, the gate is locked tight. The guards on the other side laugh and spit at you. You can't get in this way.
You enter a grim, smoky room, filled with the bitter smell of stale sweat. Twitching, vacant souls loll about on filthy beds, taking long sips from vials of bitter green fluid. It's a grim, dark place.=You are on a stairway leading up to the ramparts of the city.
You flip through the garrison commander's books. They are mainly accounts and notes on the war with the golems. There are notes on a Tevrono general's success against the golems, and about possible grounds upon which he could be arrested.
You crawl through the tunnel, heading towards a light in the distance. In doing so, you have to slide down about twenty feet. You soon emerge at the base of Gale's walls. Unfortunately, you won't be able to climb back up.
You find a secret door in the cell wall. It's not even well concealed - it's as if they wanted you to be able to escape. However, the tunnel on the other side is thick with a ripe, decaying smell. It's very peculiar.
You carefully decode a book on alchemy. It's a recipe for a powerful poison, made out of Mandrake Root. You can now make Killer Poison.
You have the good fortune of finding an old spellbook on one of the higher shelves. There's only one spell in it of interest to you, but you read it carefully. You can now cast Antimagic Cloud.
You find a steel tablet, with the instructions for casting a spell etched in tiny glyphs upon it. You carefully decipher the instructions. You can now cast the spell Mass Paralysis.
You find a book about a great hero, named Pachtar. The last of his great deeds was to try to wipe out a nest of drakes on a small island just east of the Isle of Bigail. In this assault he was slain and his body was lost. 
The book gives directions to the drake lair, at the north end of the small island. It also mentions that his legendarily powerful armor, the Plate of Pachtar, was lost in this dungeon.gYou open a secret door. As you do, a loud, keening alarm sounds. You hear shouts of alarm from outside.
You hear a grating, disembodied voice. It says _You are not authorized to go forward. Turn back, or you will face overwhelming, deadly force._
You find a small skiff at the end of the dock. Looking south across the water, you can see a shadowy, mysterious island. However, sailors are everywhere. You won't be able to steal the skiff - you'll have to find its owner.
You row the skiff across to the dark, ruined island. After a bit of looking, you are able to find a secure place to dock it - a crumbling dock in a small, ruined town.
You find a hideously grisly sight. A Nephilim has been hung from this tree. The still body hangs there, its feet two feet from the ground. It was a pathetic, bedraggled creature, missing much fur and many teeth. It looks even worse now.
A sign hanging around its neck gives a clue of why the poor creature was slain. it simply says _GALE WILL NOT TOLERATE PARASITES OR FILTHY KITTIES!_
Nervously, you down the bitter, green fluid. It stings as it goes down. Then, suddenly, you feel energy fill you! You feel stronger, and more energetic. Your spell casters feel their power increase. You feel like rushing out and slaying something evil!
You down the bitter, green fluid. As usual, it stings as it goes down. Unfortunately, it doesn't have quite the energetic effect it used to. It simply calms the powerful urge for the stuff you felt surging inside you.
You feel horribly ill. A massive craving for more Skribbane Herb overwhelms you. Sweat breaks out on your forehead, and your muscles ache. You feel intensely weak. If you don't find some soon, this weakness may well continue.iYou pay the parasite the demanded gold. The townsperson graces you with a mocking smile, and wanders off.UYou refuse to pay the extortion money. The townsperson smiles wryly, and wanders off.
Suddenly, Gale guards surround you! They draw their weapons, massive greatswords and halberds, and demand you come with them. There are too many of them, too well backed up, for you to be able to fight them. You surrender.
They take you into city hall, and throw you into a foul-smelling cell. The door is locked and barred. Oddly, they don't take your equipment.
As you enter, Pasi comes up behind you and says _By the way, be sure to be careful. People know what you did about the golems, but the mayor is jealous. Mentioning it will get them killed. Stay away from city hall, that's for sure!_ You go through.
You find an intriguing book in Gale's excellent library. However, you don't quite have the magical savvy to figure out what it's saying. All you know is that it's about something magical.mYou suspect the wall here may have a small, concealed door. However, you can't figure out how to get it open.
This door has been sealed off. Metal bars block it shut. A sign nailed to the door reads _Library closed until further notice._ You note the door has no keyhole. A key would do you no good here.HYou find a stout oaken door with a small keyhole. None of your keys fit.kYou find a stout oaken door with a small keyhole. Fortunately, your electrum key fits. You unlock the door.
You enter the village of Silvar. Coincidentally, Silvar is the name of one of the largest cities in Exile. Who knows? Perhaps it was founded by a homesick person from here.
This is interesting. You find someone has placed a hidden door in this wall. Behind it is small, natural cavern, blocked off by the barracks wall. You wonder who would add something like this.
These barracks are still clean, pristine, and new. Clearly no soldiers have been moved in to fill them yet, but it probably won't be that way for long.|Someday, this room will be the office of some high up Exile bureaucrat. Right now, it's being used to store office supplies.
These chambers are a lot nicer and more carefully built than the other areas you've seen. This is probably where the high ranking officials and other big mucky-mucks will hang out.
You find a splintered and broken pedestal, with the scraps of a shredded velvet pillow on top. Whatever valuable item was kept here, it's gone now.xThere was once a large, heavily reinforced door here. Someone, however, has blasted this huge door clean off his hinges.
There is a small storeroom here, off the side of the main storeroom. You find a note on the door: _Please reserve items inside for surface exploration team._ You would guess that this means you.
Piles of ice keep this room nice and chilly. Sides of giant lizard and sacks of fresh picked mushrooms are heaped around the room, ready to feed hungry soldiers. Must be the pantry.
This is the north gate, through which you must pass to reach the world's surface. It is blocked by a lava pool with a narrow bridge over it, which can be collapsed in case of Empire attack.
You read the tiny runes on the pages of the tome, but, try as you might, you can't make any sense of them. Perhaps if you studied your Mage Lore a bit more...
The tome is a book of prayers - arcane holy rituals to supplicate the gods. After intense study, you learn a new spell. You can now cast Symbiosis.
The tome contains a variety of magical incantations. Most of them are either irrelevant to dungeon crawling, or too bizarre to understand. One of them, however, is quite useful. You can now cast True Sight.
This chamber is thick with the raw stink of animal feed and fresh dung. There are cells ringing the room, several of which hold strange creatures from the surface world. They must be here for study.
The corridor here is blocked by some sort of a magical barrier. It's thin as a bubble, and seems just as insubstantial. However, you know very well how misleading appearances can be when dealing with magical matters.
You touch the barrier lightly. It throws your hand back with daunting force. Your wrist is slightly sprained. You back away quickly, before something worse happens.
You encounter the magical barrier Mazumdar told you about. You make the hand motions she described. It disappears for a moment, and you walk through.
This room is magically kept hot and humid, and is filled with a refreshing plant smell. To the north is a wide variety of flora, neatly organized and ready for careful study by the fort mages.
You step on the rune, and something remarkable happens. The plants to the north are now surrounded with bright auras. Looking closely at them, you feel you can sense things about their health and uses. You step off the rune, and the effect fades.
You step out of your quarters, and into one of the many cavernous halls of Fort Emergence. The corridors are eerily quiet ... only a small fraction of the troops that will be stationed here have arrived yet. Time to go get your orders.
These are Runes of Confining, designed to hold all manner of dangerous creatures. When you step onto one, every hair on your bodies stands on end. It's not a comfortable feeling.`You pull the lever, and all of the cell doors open. You hope this doesn't get anyone mad at you.>You pull the lever, and all the cell doors clatter shut again.
You relax in a comfortable bed, are brought a delicious hot meal, settle down for a nice bath, return, and suit back up. For those in your profession, it's very rare to bask in so much luxury.
You descend into the Slime Pit. You have to be careful not to touch anything - everything is coated with goo, and pitted by the acid the slimes constantly ooze. The place is dark, and humid, and horribly dangerous ...
The cavern is still abandoned. The slimes stopped regenerating themselves following the death of the Alien Slime. The thick odor of decomposition fills the passages, and clings to your armor.
The slimes in this chamber make no move to attack you. Instead, they're doing something very odd. They seem to be trying to adopt a humanoid form. Each surges upward, taking on shapes which are crude parodies of the human body.
Then, having no skeleton, they collapse, the humanoid shapes melting like candle wax. The slimes then try again. You can't imagine why they would be doing this, or how to reconcile it with the slime's apparent mindlessness.ySomeone has placed a tightly sealed, slime-proof box in this passage. It seems like a supply cache, but who left it here?
The layer of goo which coats everything in these caves stops abruptly here, as if the slimes were hesitant to go any farther down this passage.
The water makes your lips briefly glow green as you drink. The fluid contains a lot of energy, energy that flows into you. You feel refreshed!
You drink some more of the water, and, as before, it makes your lips glow briefly green. The magic starts to act on your body, but in a different way. Waves of pain wrack your bodies. Soon, the pain fades, but you are left feeling very weak.
You drink some of the water, but its magical energy has faded, all drained off into you. The green glow on your lips is the only effect that remains.
You find a row of carefully sealed, slime-proof boxes. This is definitely a storeroom of some sort. One thing is sure ... this room wasn't set up by the mindless lumps of protoplasm roaming these tunnels.
From these caverns, you hear low, gurgling, agonized moans, as if something was being tortured while its mouth was filled with goo. You don't think you're going to like what you see.
You stick a sword into the writhing, agonized being, ending its misery. You then quickly clean off the blade. One less horror in the world.
You leave the mutating beast, glistening with acidic juices, behind. You can barely bring yourself to look at it, let alone touch it with one of your weapons.
The markings on the scraps of armor remaining in this cave mark these bodies as Empire soldiers. They must have been trapped here, and weren't able to defend themselves against the inevitable waves of slimes. Just a few more deaths caused by the plague.
The entry passage ends in a large, moist cavern. Looking at the omnipresent ooze, you can't help but fervently wish to never hear the word 'slime' again.
As you begin to enter the cave, you are ambushed. Slimes ooze from cracks in the ceiling, and drop in front of and behind you. You are in great danger of being digested.
You're having to struggle to remain on your feet. The floor gets slicker and slicker the further in you go. The goop is slowly eating through the soles of your boots. This cavern is not a friendly place to be.
You peer inside, and see rapidly changing images of other caverns in this dungeon. You see many tunnels, filled with slimes slithering about.  You also see large green pools of slime, out of which small slimes are crawling. You count five of these pools.
Most notably, you see an massive creature, all tentacles and teeth, hauling its bulk back and forth through a huge cavern. The presence of this viewer is evidence that someone created these caverns for the slimes. They couldn't have made this themselves.8The orb only contains mist. You see nothing else inside.
The slimes have dragged a number of bloated bodies here. The dead are from a variety of humanoid species, and have been dead for varying amounts of time. This is a horrifying place, making the rest of these tunnels seem homey by comparison.{You get a little too close to one of the bloated bodies. Your stomach isn't strong enough to withstand it. You feel ill ...
This small subterranean building probably didn't have anything to do with the slimes being here - they have been slowly eating away at its walls. They haven't eaten through to the room to the south, but they're getting close.
You enter the innermost room of the ruins, and find a dried out husk of  a body. It's very thin; whoever it was probably was trapped here by the slimes and starved. When you enter, however, the body gets up. It's not quite dead.
This mage was a bit of a deranged loner. The book mostly contains bizarre rantings. A careful inspection, however, does reveal a few spells among the weirdness. You now know the spells Wall of Force and Flame Arrows.
This mage was a bit of a deranged loner. The book mostly contains bizarre rantings. There may be something interesting buried in here, but you don't have the magical knowledge necessary to pick it out.
You see several slimes sitting on glowing runes. They seem to be sucking up energy. The last thing you expected to find in these tunnels was power-up stations for the slimes.
This hall extends beyond the range of your vision. The passage is lined with humanoid statues, covered with the ubiquitous goo. The unsettling question ... are there stone statues or dead bodies under the slime?
When you move down the passage, a barrier of green energy flashes into existence, blocking your path. You move away. The barrier drops. You approach again, and the barrier reappears.
The barrier is blocking you from the innermost chamber of the Slime Fortress. It's too powerful for you to bring it down now ... you'll have to find a way to knock it down somewhere else.
An excited zombie is often heard to emit a long, low, hissing noise when attacking. A slime zombie does something similar, but it's more of a bubbling sound. This is relevant, because you start to hear the this noise behind you. The bodies have risen.
The bodies ahead are old, withered, and covered with goo. However, they show a worrying lack of decomposition. Fortunately, they don't attack you when you approach.zThese passages are slime-free, and have the cool, clean, quiet feel of a laboratory. The air is still, and slightly stale.
You scrape off the fibrous gook holding the man in place. He must have been paralyzed by a slime, and then wrapped in webs and goo. He was imprisoned in his armor, and his equipment is still nearby!
He stands up and blinks his eyes. You try to talk to him, but he can only grunt and twitch in return. His experience has left him completely unhinged. He grabs his equipment and runs off, howling angrily.
You move close to the rune, and the energy the slimes were absorbing begins to course instead into you. You feel your magical batteries refilling.
The rune begins to course energy into you. However, this time the energy is not quite compatible with your bodies. You jump away, but not until you feel much weaker.
The rune glows dimly now. It's burned itself out trying to pump energy into you. You touch it, but only feel a weak warmth. No more help to be had here.
This outer corridor is here to provide the rest of the Tower of Magi some insulation from the intense energy of the portal. The portal's power makes every hair on your body stand straight out, and you feel quite queasy. Nobody spends much time in here.OA plaque reads: |In memory of Silverio. Mighty wizard. |Lost in the Empire War.\A plaque reads: |In memory of Patrick and his many years of service to Exile. Rest in peace.
To the south is the towering, fiery portal that carries hundreds of people every day up to the surface and back down to Exile. To the north, through curving, shielded, passages, is the Tower of Magi.
Again, you feel the combined sensations of vertigo, nausea, and terror. The portal rips you into tiny pieces, and reassembles you in the Portal Fortress.
To the north, past thick, lead-lined walls, lies the surface portal. To the south is the Tower of Magi's main laboratory, where reality becomes more warped every day. A walkway leads out of the laboratory, provided to steer people in the right direction.
This is a secluded meeting room. Three ornate chairs face each other over a brazier. A fire burns in the brazier, but you see no fuel sustaining it. You try to enter, but an invisible barrier blocks you. A voice says _Triad members only, please._
This is the laboratory where student mages first learn the art of Tampering In God's Domain. Mistakes are, of course, inevitable, which explains the thick layer of lead on the walls, and that smell of burned meat.
The passage is blocked by an invisible, impenetrable wall. A voice says _Linda has requested that this passage be off-limits to unauthorized personnel. Thank you for your consideration._
This corridor is cool and calm, and leads to a series of ornate doors. A nameplate hangs on each door, each with a single mage's sigil carved on it. These must be the wizard's quarters.xYou stare longingly at the passage that leads out to Exile, but then turn back. Your business is back up on the surface.
The Vahnatai decor in this room takes you by surprise at first. Then you notice that the chairs have been built for humans, not the much lighter, thinner Vahnatai. Someone must have decided to build the council room in a different style.
The case is filled with scrolls! You're excited at first, until you realize that the scrolls are covered with records of Tower of Magi business so tedious and repetitive they'd make an accountant commit suicide from boredom.
This is where people are billeted while waiting for their turn to use the surface portal. The quarters are quite cramped and uncomfortable. The Tower of Magi seems unconcerned with providing creature comforts for outsiders.
This is the dining hall for people waiting to use the portal. The room is cramped and dirty, and a pot of stew is overcooking on the fire.
For aesthetic reasons, the door to the room where gardening supplies are stored has been concealed. The stuff doesn't look too interesting.
You crack open the book and begin to read. It's the journal of a mage named Orvid's dealings with dark powers. It's horrid, disturbing stuff, but you find yourself unable to stop reading. You learn the spell Major Summoning, but feel unhinged.
You crack open the pages of the book nervously, only to find that it's written in a magical dialect you don't understand. Maybe if you studied mage lore a bit more, you'd be able to comprehend it.
Nobody disturbs your rest. You get a very refreshing 8 hours of sleep. When you wake up, someone even brings you water to wash up with. What luxury!
It looks like some people were staying in this room up until very recently. Their stuff is gone, but the beds haven't been made and things haven't been fully cleaned up.
This room is filled floor to ceiling with webs. Peculiar, but you have a hard time finding anything that happens in this place to be unusual.
This concealed room is simply the robing room for the temple. Most temples have one, where the minister prepares before beginning a service.
This is an unused storeroom.
This looks like a store, but it's cluttered with amazing amounts of junk, most of it clearly useless. Making your way to the counter will take some effort and some careful stepping.
This is the Tower of Magi's secondary laboratory, where the more peculiar, unimportant, and sometimes dangerous experiments take place.
The altar glows, and bathes you in a warm light. Your donation and life of questing is rewarded, in the form of greater knowledge. Your mind opens up, and you see things much more clearly now.
You browse the notebook as you pass. The Tower of Magi somehow caught several of the surface creatures you've been fighting, and has been studying them. A note on the front of the notebook requests that visitors stop here, to avoid damaging the specimens.
This portal was Exile's connection to the lands of the Vahnatai. It still exists, but just barely. It flickers in and out of existance, and is clearly far too weak to use. The room is filled with dust. Nobody has been here in a while.>You place a few coins into the chest. Very responsible of you.CNobody is looking. You can help yourself to the tithes if you want.bYou kneel at the shrine, and receive a warm, satisfied feeling. And nothing else. You get back up.
You kneel at the altar, and immediately feel a heavy weight press down upon your mind. Your thoughts become confused. Then, satisfied, the altar releases you.
You move through a tiny secret door in a remote corner of the Tower, and find yourself in a disused storeroom. The south wall of the storeroom is crumbling - it looks like it received a massive impact from the other side.bThese bodies look like they were students at the magic school here. They all died quite violently.
You find the crumpled form of Mahdavi, member of the Triad of the Tower of Magi. Something flung her into the west wall with such force that the rock cracked. She slumps on the floor like a doll with most of the stuffing taken out.
You enter the Tower of Magi through a huge hole that's been blasted into the wall. The formerly bright halls now stink of sulphur and echo with inhuman roars. You also hear a soft human voice: _In the meeting room! Quickly!_
Following the destruction of its creators and controllers, the surface portal is slowly starting to fall apart. It wavers and stutters, sending jets of energy flying about the ruin. It's far too dangerous to use.
The thick, insulated walls protecting the tower from the energy of the surface portal have started to come down, revealing a dangerous, out of control tower of red energy. Any skin exposed to it starts to tingle and hurt within seconds.
Three impressive, carved stone chairs dominate this small meeting room. Surprisingly, the demons have pretty much left it alone.
The room to the south must have been Linda's laboratory. The floor in the middle glows red hot, and runes appear and fade on the surface of the semi-molten rock. This must be where she first summoned the creatures that destroyed the Tower.6Several torn bodies have been cast carelessly in here.^This was one of the Tower guards. Something took her head clean off, and left the body behind.
As you approach the entrance gate of the Tower of Magi, fiery sheets of lightning spring across the open portcullises, blocking your exit. You leap back just in time to avoid a very quick death.xThe body of the proprietor of this store lies before you. Something nailed him with a very large piece of thrown marble.DSomebody got totally blasted here. Only a thick reddish goo remains.
You lie down for a nice rest, and, strangely, have an all too easy time going to sleep. Your sleep is so sound that it isn't even disturbed when the demons rip into you.
You make your way into the Tower of Magi's temple, the only room to remain completely undamaged by the demon's attack. The good energy of the place heats the air around you, keeping the demons at bay.
As you stare at the holy altar to the south, you cannot help but wonder how long it's going to last before the foul creatures break through its defenses.
The altar reaches into its last reserves of energy and gives some of it to you. There is a flash of light, and you feel replenished!TYou kneel and touch the white marble, but the altar has nothing left to give to you.
A guttural voice booms through the Tower's halls: _I sense you here! You have come to me? Hide and scurry if you like, for soon my servants will find you!_
The horrible voice rings out again, coming from all around you. _Still struggling? I have gained enough force to act!_ Suddenly, a cloud of sparks springs from the walls! It ends abruptly, but not before you are burned.
The voice roars out. _I am closer with every moment! Take this, worms!_ A hot wind rises up, scouring the room and halls of the Tower of Magi. It does a good job of boiling you in your armor before it dies away.
You take up the Blessed Athame. As you do, creatures appear all around you! The massive demon leading them croaks _Thank you so much! We couldn't get it from the altar, but we can certainly get it from you!_ They attack.
You swing your blade at the portal, trying to destroy it. The steel passes through it without effect. Linda says _No! That will trap Grah-Hoth here! Enter me ... it's our only hope!_
You step forward. Linda lurches forward to engulf you. The last thing you hear is her screaming  _Fools!_ Then you find yourself in Grah-Hoth's domain. You are overpowered, and he has great fun with you before he finally lets you die.
You break the glass hemisphere, and soothing green gas rises up into the air. It  smells like fresh cut grass, and energizes you as you inhale it. It cleanses your system of all disease, and dissipates. Unfortunately, that was the only glass full of gas.
As you walk along the lab table, one of the small glass vials, which looked like it was empty, suddenly shatters. Unfortunately, it was near you. You start to feel very ill.
Looking through the windows, you see a wide corridor, about thirty feet below you. It leads to the inner depths of the Filth Factory, as the rich, horrid stench wafting out indicates.
It must be the corridor from which the newly hatched roaches emerge to spread havoc and disease. Indeed, many of the insects, most the size of your fists, are running out. If you want to destroy the Factory, down there is probably where you want to get.
This is a laboratory, probably the place where many of the ideas and spells used to create the Filth Factory were developed. Many empty vials, beakers and tubes, many of those broken, line two long lab tables. Little of the stuff looks useful.
This massive cauldron seems to be used to take the filth and trash already assembled in this place, and somehow make it even ranker and more disgusting. Stuff that looks like swamp muck and rotten plants pours in through tubes in the roof.
It swirls around in the basin, mixing with more disgusting stuff from other, smaller tubes. It then swirls down a pit in the middle, heading to parts unknown. This basin looks like a very dangerous place to enter.
The spiraling whirlpool of semi-liquid swamp goo catches you up, and swirls you into the pit. Before you reach the lower levels, though, huge knives and gears chop you up into small pieces. Soon, you will be exceptionally tasty roach food.
This chamber is where, you would guess, trash and filth are in some way refined to make it into better roach food. Filth is pouring into two huge, disgusting vats, where it is being mixed and impurified. Ick.
From this viewing chamber, you have an excellent view of the pit below, where the roaches are raised and fed before being sent out into the cold, cruel world. Windows hold off the stench, so you get a better view.
Below, you see several massive, concentric rings of tightly packed, green, organic trash. Huge roaches lurch among them, laying eggs and carrying food to the youngsters. Many young roaches walk out below you, perhaps to the outside. It's a huge operation.
oThis was some sort of control panel. However, someone was careful to smash it before leaving. It's useless now.
Through this open portcullis, you can see a massive trench. Noxious slime was pouring through there until very recently. You can go through now, if you want, although it may not be safe for long.
Through the portcullis, you see a river of highly processed and noxious filth, 3 feet deep, pouring out to the west to feed the roaches below. If you were in there, you would be instantly swept away and die in a truly horrid way.
As your feet threaten to slip out from under you, you work your way up the slick trench. Behind you is a pit, into which the goo recently poured. To the east, positioned just above the flow, you see a door.
You continue to work your way east. You hear machinery rumbling and shaking. Soon, the river will start up again, and the trench will be full. You'd better hurry.uYou pull the lever, hoping for a useful result. Instead, you hear a broken, grinding sound, and nothing else happens.
These rooms were barracks for whoever helped create this place. The open doors, empty rooms, and nondescript trash tell you that whoever was here made sure to clean out every hint of their identity before leaving.pThere is writing on the chest, which changes to become readable as you look at it. It says _Emergency supplies._
As you walk down the corridor, you hear a rumbling noise behind you. You look back, and see that the wall has shifted away, revealing a room filled with bones and skulls.
The constant flowing, rumbling sound that echoes through the factory has stopped. The flow of filth into the lower levels has stopped, at least temporarily.hYou hear grinding and rumbling. You would guess that the factory is gearing up to start itself up again.
The grinding and gurgling noises start to echo through the factory walls again. The flow of filth will no doubt start up again soon.
Suddenly, the sound of flowing slime starts echoing through the Filth Factory. It looks like the factory is able to restart itself. You aren't going to have much luck shutting the place down using the Control Room.
With a roar, a river of slime pours out through the grates to the east. It catches you up and pulls you into the pits to the west, where you drown in graywater. It's a serious downer.kYou step into the teleporter. With a flash of light and an odd sensation, you find yourself somewhere else.tSome cruel and twisted being has set up a kennel here. You can easily guess what horrid fate awaits these poor pups.
IThis passage is chilly and still, and there's a layer of dust everywhere.
Eww! Ick! A bunch of tiny roaches climb up on you! You stop everything to swat and brush them off. When you're done, your packs feel lighter.
This is where the fetid goo pours in from the upper level, and a trench, and into a hole. From here, it's spread all throughout the roach pit. Unfortunately, the river is too wide and fast to cross easily. You'll have to find a way around.zFortunately, a recent earthquake has opened a large crack in the wall. You can, with difficulty, make your way through it.
One of your characters is standing in the newly restarted filth flow. Your bold companion in arms is instantly pulled off into the pits to the west, and drowns.
Behind these slabs of basalt, you can hear magical machinery working busily. The rock is pretty strong, and probably magically protected. You give yourselves low odds of being able to destroy the machinery.@You step onto the rune. Your skin tingles. Nothing else happens.
The purpose of this rune is to magically slice apart and break open any body put onto it, for close inspection. It isn't picky about whether that body is alive or dead. You suddenly suffer a serious case of indigestion.
Bad news. Someone has blocked off this passage with a massive barrier. One thing is clear - the creators of this place have gone to great lengths to keep anyone from reaching the lower levels.
This room is where young troglodytes who want to become warriors are tested. The implements and objects around the chamber indicate it's probably not a pleasant process.
Of course, the altar immediately realizes you're not troglodytes, and reacts badly to your presence. Fortunately, it only absorbs all of your spell points to recharge itself.UYou Sanctify the altar. All of its energy leaks out, and the stone cracks. Well done.
The reek in this room makes your stomach do a flip flop. This is where the troglos throw all their trash. A small window in the south wall isn't helping ventilate the room at all.
These troglodytes are a people who attach great importance to their ancestors. Unfortunately, they're also a people without a past. Created by whoever created them out of thin air, their rootlessness is clearly jarring to them.
You now see how they make up for it. You see many statues of troglos, all taller and more regal than they could have possibly been in life. The subjects died in recent battles, and then became the honored ancestors these creatures so clearly crave.~You can barely make out the outlines of a secret door. Unfortunately, you make no progress in figuring out how to get it open.
Interesting. Given their gross appearance and behavior, most people tend to think of troglodytes as a mindless scourge. However, this well-stocked and neatly arranged library indicates that whatever else their merits, they're definitely literate.
Suddenly and with the grinding of massive, hidden gears, the floor you're walking over slides out from under you. The bed of coals underneath holds the promise of great and instant pain.
Well, this is a bad sign. There is a dead body in here, still in its armor with Empire insignia. Whoever he was, he was left in this room to starve.
You have found a hidden passage out. No doubt after you pass the troglos will block it up. After all, they aren't stupid. You think.kA horde of massive, very assertive troglodytes block your path. They clearly don't want you to go this way.
You finally reach the inner chamber of Elhioc, leader of the Khazis, total foe of humanity, and total paranoid. He has plenty of guards here, and not because he's expecting you. They draw weapons, and attack.
These are Elhioc's spartan living quarters. The mighty Khazi lives like the lowest of his kind - sleeping on a thin, straw pad on the cave floor.
This is Elhioc's private altar. Unlike many of the other troglodyte's altars, this one isn't enchanted. It's just there for his private prayers. The craftsmanship in the carvings is elegant and beautiful.oYou read Elhoic's prayer book. Fortunately, it isn't trapped. Unfortunately, you can't understand a word of it.
You read Elhoic's prayer book. Fortunately, it isn't trapped. You read it carefully, and learn the spells Wall of Blades and Major Cleansing.
This is the chamber where troglodytes lock up those the khazis have declared heretics. The chilling smell of decay testifies clearly what happens then.
The runes on the cover of the book were exactly what you suspected - a trap. The troglodytes are deadly serious about keeping outsiders from reading their holy secrets. Flames erupt, searing you.
The bed of rubble to the north was created by a mated pair of drakes. The troglodytes clearly have a taste for unusual pets. Or allies.
The bookshelves are covered with books captured from humans, each showing the signs of heavy reading by the troglodytes. You pull one of them off to inspect it. It doesn't come out, however. Instead, the bookshelf swings away from the wall!
You surprise two pairs of troglodytes, two shamans, two warriors, arguing over a table. This must be where the holy and military sides of troglo society meet to discuss matters. The creatures rapidly settle their difference, however, to fight you.
The altar in this room is small, simple, and non-magical. There are two kneeling pads before it, facing each other. This must be a small, private meeting room.
You reach the top of the stairs, and meet a thick clot of troglodyte guards. King Vothkaro must have stationed them there to make sure you leave through the right stairway. You turn back.
You disrupt and shatter yet another of the troglodytes' altars. Surprisingly, this one didn't even have any defenses to blast you with. It just smokes and cracks, and that's the end of it.
This room has eight pipes in the ceiling, each with a cap over the end. The caps are open. Barrels can be put under the pipes to catch anything that might come out of them. Maybe slime can be routed into here for sampling.
This room has eight pipes in the ceiling, each with a cap over the end. The caps are closed. Barrels can be put under the pipes to catch anything that might come out of them. Maybe slime can be routed into here for sampling.;You pull the lever. The vents on the ceiling open up again.QYou pull the lever. The vents on the ceiling close themselves, and seal up tight.+You hear a weird buzzing for a few moments.SYou hear distant machinery kick in, and hear a soft rumbling noise. Soon, it stops.cThe machinery stops, as does the rumbling. Whatever process you set into motion, you've stopped it.nYou hear a loud rumbling, as if something is going wrong or breaking down. The floor vibrates under your feet.
You hear a loud explosion from the south. The machinery noise, the rumbling, and the vibrations stop abruptly. A horrid smell reaches you.
The machinery noise, the rumbling, and the vibrations stop abruptly. You think you hear a loud splashing noise in the distance.
The pipes drip slightly, having just deposited a payload of fresh effluvium into the barrels. A few of the spouts missed, making a mess on the floor. Fortunately, the caps on the pipes were open. Otherwise, something very messy might have happened.^The distant soft humming of machinery kicks in. The sounds start to slowly build in intensity.
There has been an explosion in this chamber. Somehow, the pipes started trying to expel effluvia while the caps on the ends were closed. The pressure caused them to burst. Interestingly, the blast has broken down the wall in the corner of the room.
When you say you don't have the papers, the response is magical fire, which flies across the portcullises. You leap back, just barely avoiding being crisped. The troglodytes clearly don't plan to let you in. 
_Show us the papers, then!_ the voice barks. You hold up a piece of paper with writing on it, hoping whoever it is can't read. No dice. Flames fly across the portcullis. You leap back just quickly enough to save your lives.
As you're marched along to the holding cell, one of the troglos mutters _Wonder why they're back._ You then hear another troglo knock the other one unconscious. The blindfold is removed, and you're in the holding cell again.
They aren't pleased. Realizing you're surrounded by dozens of troglodytes, with more surely nearby, you back away. The troglos reenter the castle. You're alone again.
The troglodytes blindfold you, double-check to make sure you can't see, and haul you somewhere. You're half led, half dragged, and fall to your knees several times. On the way, your hear one of the troglos ask who you are, and get clubbed unconcious.
Finally, the blindfolds (along with some of your hair) are torn off, and you're thrown into a holding cell. There's a filthy bed, a chamber pot, and a very thick door. The door is slammed shut, and you hear several bolts being set.
Suddenly, you hear the door being unlocked. Someone outside says _King Vothkaro will see you now._ Then you hear footsteps receding down the hall outside. Then you don't hear anything else.vThe door is unlocked again. You hear someone on the other side mutter _King Vothkaro will see you now._ and walk away.
BHe looks very annoyed. _Well, read it then! There is little time._
You check carefully for traps, and find no signs of any. You open the chest, and see, too late, a rune inscribed inside the lid. Sparks fly out ...|This is a concealed door leading out of the flaming temple. Definitely a fortuitous find. As you leave, the fires fade away.
You gingerly take the knife and the coins. At first, it seems like nothing bad is going to happen. Then a small compartment opens in the walls behind the altar. There is an reddish-gold egg inside it. Then the egg cracks, and flames pour out ...
The thick mist and the odor of rotten eggs in this cavern make your eyes water and fill your mouth with an unpleasant taste. You see several natural hot springs, heated by magma and hot gasses. This might make a good tourist destination someday.
You see the burial mounds of dead hill giant warriors. Little trinkets and bits of carved stone adorn the graves. You notice that the carvings are, while not valuable, quite intricate, especially considering how big and clumsy the giants' fingers are.
You smell fresh air! You see sunlight to the east. There's an exit here, concealed by a thick mass of trees and brush. If someone wanted to escape from here, this would be the natural place to do it.
You are at the entrance to the Caverns of the Hill Giants, a network of massive corridors and chambers, located in a region of considerable volcanic activity. The caves are humid, and filled with the smells of sulphur and rank, unwashed giants.
From inside, you hear the bubbling of magma, the chipping of stone clubs being carved, and the chanting of shamans. Bits of rubble and crushed basalt are everywhere, as well as a disturbing number of bone chips ...
You chop your way through the thick brush. Odd - you'd swear it's growing back even as you hack at it. You look back, and see that the brush behind you is too thick for you to return. This exit must be magically protected to keep people from sneaking in.
You enter the lower chambers of the Caverns of the Giants. The ceilings and most of the walls are covered with a glowing moss, the sort that lights much of Exile. You won't need your lights down here. You give thanks for small blessings.
You hike down the long passage. There are only torches for a few hundred feet. The corridor goes on for miles after that. After a few hours, you come to another cave ...
Sensing great danger, you walk into this cave very cautiously. It seems quiet and empty, except for a soft hissing noise. Then several giants walk out of hiding to the west. One of them is huge, and holds an enormous stone club.
They don't move to attack, however. You soon see why ... several snakes slither out of small holes in the walls. They're over twenty feet long each, and each has the face of a woman. They laugh. Then the giants bow to them, and move to attack.
These caverns must have some religious significance - they're filled with totems, trophies, and offerings. Oddly, not all the trophies are the standard bones and skulls. There are also intricate stone carvings, painted skins, and even bunches of flowers.
When you get close, you see that there are stepping stones in the lava to the south of you. You may be able to cross to the island safely.
This door looks extremely sturdy, and has a massive iron padlock. It looks very easy to pick. However, when you try to approach, you find that a strange force is holding you back. You can't get close to the door.}This door looks extremely sturdy, and has a massive iron padlock. You walk up and try the giant's key. Sure enough, it works.
This room is built with a craftsmanship that would be exceptional by human standards, let alone giant. In the middle of the room, intricately shaped golden runes have been set into the floor. You notice they're surrounded by small buttons ...
You reach a shrine of sorts, where the giants have placed the most prized of their trophies. You aren't sure what sort of things the giants would value most, but you'd bet there's some really valuable stuff.
You find a body in this small cave, lying on a small stone bier. Even though the style of clothing marks this mage's corpse as terribly old, it's still as fresh as if it died this morning. Strange, but no stranger than a lot of things in this place.
This is a workshop, where many large, round stones are worked and chipped into throwing boulders. Chisels and adzes are everywhere, so that the craftsgiants who live in this cave can work the stones into just the right shapes.
Some of the finished stones have runes and carvings on them, some surprisingly delicate, none of which are likely to survive being thrown. Why the giants feel such a need to decorate their weapons, you'll likely never know.
Most of these books are completely incomprehensible to you. One isn't - it's a human's prayer book! Whatever it's doing here, you are able to make use of it. You now know the spell Divine Thud.
Most of these books are completely bizarre. One isn't. It's a small spell book, with the symbol of the archmage Erika on the cover! You read it carefully. You now know the spell Mindduel.
Most of these books are completely incomprehensible to you. One of them is slightly less so. It's clearly of human origin, but you still can't understand it.
You get a sinking feeling. Literally. The conveyor belt is about to drop you into a huge, flaming pit of magma. You're in big trouble.
You enter some sort of audience hall. It's been a while since it was used ... everything is covered with dust. That includes the several Demon Golem guards. For the sake of neatness, they brush off the dust before moving to kill you.
When you step on the rune, beams of intense light from the ceiling wash over you. Moving over you in intricate patterns. Then they turn off. Very odd.:One of the conveyor belts nearby suddenly reverses itself.
This machine seems to be an ore processor, or some sort of other raw materials provider. You see it spit out a chunk of metal onto the conveyor belt, to be carried off somewhere.cYou hear the soothing hum of machinery. The tone of the conveyor belts nearby has changed slightly.
You are actually able to understand one of the scrolls on this shelf. It seems to be a schematic of the tower. It's not very detailed, but one thing is clear. The tower draws most of its power from 4 stone circles, each several miles away.
You manage to understand one of the scrolls on this shelf. It describes the machines below, which do the final assembly and spit out the golems. It says they are resistant to most attacks, but there is an unnamed 'certain spell' that can disrupt them.
You try to move out into the rest of Blackcrag Fortress, but a guard quickly moves up and shoves you back. _What are you doing?_ he hisses. _Stay back out of the way, or we'll all be in serious trouble!_ You are pushed back inside.
Your excitement at finding such a beautiful and well-equipped library is short lived. All the books are either fiction or dry historical tomes. Nothing magical, nothing useful.
You gasp in awe at the resplendent chamber before you. The walls, floor, and ceiling of semi-precious stone, the intricate  craftsmanship, and the fountain with magical flames erupting in the center make this the loveliest room you've ever seen.
To the east, however, is a sight to inspire even more awe. And fear, as well. Sitting on her throne, watching you cautiously, is Empress Prazac, absolute monarch of the Empire. She motions for you to approach.
This weapons storeroom has been cleaned out. There isn't much dust, so it must have been emptied very recently. A lot of troops have been outfitted from here.
As the last Empire monarch was killed by Exiles, the Empire guards have been keeping a close eye on you. Alas, you've just confirmed their suspicions regarding your trustworthiness. Many guards converge upon you. Your deaths are slow and horrible.
Suddenly, with several flashes of light, Empire guards appear all around you. They attack immediately! This is very strange. Why did they allow you in here, only to try and kill you in such an odd, stealthy way?
Undeterred by the pitiful squeals of the baby beasts, you torch all of the vats, one after the other. This is sure to only be a temporary solution - whoever created these things can easily build more. However, it will slow them down a little.
This room is dominated by several large troughs in alcoves in the walls. They are filled with greenish gray gook, in which dozens of baby alien beasts, none larger than your hand, swim and play. These vats must be where the creatures are born and grow!
This room is dominated by several large troughs in alcoves in the walls. They are filled with greenish gray gook, in which dozens of baby alien beasts, none larger than your hand, swim and play. These vats must be where the creatures are born and grow!
Through the massive, closed portcullis, you are able to get a look inside the black tower. It's a huge structure, forty feet high and several hundred feet across, made of one seamless sheet of black stone.
It looks like it was grown, not built, springing from the ground and throwing aside all the buildings that were there before. Inside, it is dark and smoky, and you hear what sounds like many alien beasts, growling and calling to each other.
This is the meeting room for the Keep of Tinraya's city hall. It looks like the alien beasts set this chamber aside for extra destruction. The floor is torn up, and bones are everywhere.jThe alien beasts must not be interested in literature. All the books on these shelves have been chewed up.`The lever is sticking a bit, but you manage to get it to move. Nothing happens that you can see.
As you step over the rune, a magical trap activates. Nothing fancy - just searing flames that bake you inside your armor. Fortunately, the flames die out when you reach a lovely golden brown, as opposed to when you're well done.
Even though Tinraya was ruined over a year ago, this room is still filled with the stink of death. There is no rest to be had here.
You sleep, but not well. The howls of the alien beasts grow louder and more insistent, echoing through the countryside. It's as if they're summoning more of their number to come and help hunt you.
This room looks like it's intended for use in meditation. Thick, plush rugs are arranged in front of blue crystals on low pedestals. The crystals look dull and lifeless, and everything is dusty. Nobody's used this room for a while.
That may have been a mistake. When you peer deep into the crystal, the lights spring to life, arranging and rearranging themselves in a variety of bizarre runes. They twist and rework your mind in strange ways. You stumble back, feeling faint.
You wake up in a small, rectangular room. There's no door, just wall made of a different stone. The room is empty - no beds, chairs, or windows, no food, no light. You have a bad feeling - whatever the Vahnatai have in mind for you, its not good.
Another day passes. You are starting to fade. Then, you hear a voice. It's a whisper, coming from midair. _At last, I can help you. One can leave now. Have a care. Avoid extraneous buttons. Find me in the caves beyond the Great Walls._ Then all is silent.
You find a massive door, covered with protective runes. There is a strange keyhole in the center of the door, made to fit a key with a very odd, twisted shape. Unfortunately, none of your keys fit.
You find a massive door, covered with protective runes. There is a strange keyhole in the center of the door, made to fit a key with a very odd, twisted shape. Fortunately, the key you stole from the Vahnatai works just fine. The door opens.
There is a loud rumble behind you. Looking back, you see the walls sliding way. Oh, goodie. Another bunch of alien beasts to fight.
You start to head back towards the hall with the Crystal Souls, but think better of it. By yourself, you wouldn't stand a chance. You better find your friends first, before they die of dehydration.
You find a massive door, covered with protective runes. There is a strangely shaped keyhole in the center of the door. On a hunch, you try the key you found in the murder cave near New Formello, and it works! The door opens.
From this vantage point, you see to the east a series of broad stepping stones across the river. If you could reach them, you could cross.
When you press the crystal into the pedestal, it stays there. With a satisfying rumble, one of the walls blocking off the cells slides away!
You have freed your group! You gladly rejoin them. It is a great relief to get out of that filthy cell at last, especially considering that it could very easily have been your tomb.
You step through the portal, and find yourself in a muck filled cavern. Tiny baby alien beasts, squeaking fearfully,  burrow into the slime in fear when you appear. You're free, but your companions are still prisoners.
The cave ahead is filled with foul slime and muck. Swimming in the goo are small, six-legged, squealing beasts, the size of small dogs. They're alien beasts! This must be where they grow up. The small beasts flee when they see you, no doubt to find mommy.hA day passes. No food or water is brought to you. Nobody comes to question you. Time passes in darkness.
Another day passes. Still, no food or water is brought to you, nobody comes to question you. Time passes in darkness. The cell begins to smell very bad. The suspicion grows that the Vahnatai are leaving you here to die.
Suddenly, the air is split with a shrill, warbling wail. They must be able to hear it all over the dungeon! The panel goes inactive, you hear the clattering of opening portcullises and the shouts of Vahnatai.
You open the case, and find the the control panel is inactive. The writing is all gone, and the buttons won't go in when you try to press them.
You are at the west end of a massive subterranean tunnel, burrowing up into the side of a huge, remote mountain. You are able to see because of a dim, familiar, green light. Someone has brought up some of the fluorescent mold common in Exile.
In the sickly light, you can see that the Vahnatai are rapidly constructing defenses. Three walls have been built in this passage, each heavily guarded by Vahnatai. They aren't yet completed - you may have a chance of fighting your way through.
You enter the first wall. You hear the high pitched shouts of Vahnatai running towards the fray. You also notice that the amulets Erika gave you are starting to grow very warm.`You enter the first wall. You hear the high pitched shouts of Vahnatai running towards the fray.
Suddenly, the amulets Erika gave you let fly brilliant lances of light. They fly through the wall, past the guards, into the east wall, blasting a hole through it.  You now have an instant shortcut.xYou emerge from the first fortification, to be greeted by the second. You hear the shouts of more guards deeper inside. 
This cave is bare, except for neat piles of rubble placed at the south end. It is waiting to be the final resting place of the Vahnatai defenders that are lost. The Vahnatai are truly prepared for a defense.
You have to cover your noses. The filth and garbage generated by the fort are thrown in here, waiting to be chucked into a pit and burnt up with fireballs.
You stare deep into the crystal and see maps and schematics! It looks like the plans for the Vahnatai's schemes! Unfortunately, before you can figure it all out, the magical defenses kick in. There is a flash of light, and you feel woozy.
The words flashing by inside the crystal are magical directions. This must be where Vahnatai magical training takes place. You read the runes, and learn the spell Venom Arrows.nThe runes flash when you step on them. To the south, you hear the faint sound of massive portcullises opening.
This is one of the Vahnatai's reading crystals. Normally, you'd be able to peer deep into it and see glowing words or drawings. However, it's currently inactive, and you don't know how to activate it.
Fascinating! Rentar-Ihrno has built her keep over a small, active volcanic vent, and magically channeled and harnessed its power! The hot magma bubbles up, and is then channeled into pits, where its heat can power the infernal machinery below.<Everything in here is a bit dusty. This storeroom is unused.
This room contains the starved bodies of  two humans, both in rusted Empire army armor. The Vahnatai threw them in here and left them to starve, a grisly reminder of the fate that almost befell you.@You hear the rattle and clang of a portcullis, somewhere nearby.
You peer into the crystal, trying to make sense of the schematics and plans moving by. They move too fast and are too confusing. You only succeed in giving yourself a draining headache. The crystal goes dark.
You again try to understand the writing in these crystals. It continues to confuse you and gives you another nasty headache. However, you think you're slowly starting to make sense of it. This crystal goes dark.
You again try to understand the writing in these crystals. It still confuses you somewhat, but at least it doesn't give you a headache. You think you're almost starting to make sense of them. This crystal goes dark.
Eureka! The crystals are showing schematics of this keep! Below you are four vats, from which fluid can be directed into a central pit. From there, the fluid can be magically changed using controls in Rentar-Ihrno's hall.
This room shows the scars of many combats. The wall scarred with spells gone awry, and semi-fresh bloodstains are everywhere. This must be where newly designed creatures are brought to test their combat effectiveness.
The room to the south contains two prepared platforms, where Crystal Souls may stay to provide guidance. However, the Souls have been removed - probably in order to keep them in a place safe from you.
You peer inside, and read an account of the killings of two miners near the Exile town of New Formello. They stumbled upon a hidden Vahnatai base and had to be killed. To keep the Vahnatai plans secret, the base was destroyed. This explains a lot.
You aren't able to tell much else from the crystal, except that using the controls to magically change the mix when all four fluids are in the pit has volatile results. Very interesting. This crystal goes dark.
Rentar-Ihrno decides she doesn't want you near her control panel. She tosses a powerful (and draining) spell, and you find yourself elsewhere.
Rentar-Ihrno still doesn't want you near her control panel. She casts the teleportation spell again, again moving you the entrance of the hall. You notice, however, that she has much greater difficulty casting the spell this time.
Rentar-Ihrno again tries to cast the teleportation spell. However, repeated castings of it are too draining even for her. Before she can complete the spell, you manage to reach the pedestal!
You press the button. With a honking, blatting noise, all the goo you struggled to hard to send down the channels drains away into troughs to be dumped into the chasm outside. You're back to square one.EYou press the button. The controls beep at you. Nothing else happens.
You press the button. With a deafening roar, all the goo you struggled to hard to send down the channels pours into the cauldron to the west. As it mixes, powerful reactions take place and foul smells waft up towards you.
You press another button. A powerful humming noise comes from inside the pedestal, and it begins to vibrate. It's also growing extremely hot. You wrap up your fingers with a scrap of cloth before pressing any more buttons.
You press the final button, and a lance of light fires from the pedestal into the goo mixture. The slime starts to change, writhing and taking shape. Creatures beyond description form in it, swim to the surface, and dive down, never to be seen again.
However, you don't know what to do from here, what spells to cast or what to do with the slime. There is a honking noise, and all of it drains away, to be dumped into the chasm outside. You're back to square one. 
You return to the Portal Fortress, the tower where everyone arrives in Upper Exile. Inside is a huge teleporter that carries people and supplies to and from the Tower of Magi down in Exile.
This tunnel looks like it was dug and shored up by a rough stone wall in extreme haste. The air is chill and still. Nobody comes here often. It's very creepy.9You back away from the button. Slowly. Nothing kills you.
You press the button. It stays pushed in. There's no noise, no click, no hum, no nothing. Just total silence. You get a very bad feeling, and make a break for it. You get halfway down the long corridor.
The explosion blows through thirty feet of rock, creating a new tunnel leading into the chamber with the portal. The blast also shatters every bone in your bodies, and turns your flesh to liquid. Whatever magical protection you needed, you didn't have it.
You move closer to the portal, but waves of heat and force start to push you back. Ripples of fiery red appear in its surface. You push harder, trying to get inside.
Seles jumps up and stops you. _What are you doing? The portal doesn't go anywhere now! You step in, and bits of you will be scattered from here to the sun! Idiots!_ Chastened, you back away from the portal.
You start to walk towards the portal. When you do, Seles yells _Stop!_ and guards run up to restrain you. You are marched quickly away from the portal.
Seles walks up to you annoyed. _What did you think you were doing? You must get permission specifically from me to use the portal. Said permission you do not have. Now back off!_ The guards release you, and give you nasty looks.
You start to walk into the portal. You feel resistance as you approach ... waves of heat and force try to throw you back. You push harder, moving slowly and carefully into the glowing pillar of energy.
Soon, everything goes black. Then which, then orange, then green, then colors you don't have words for. Then you find yourself ...
To the southwest, you see the portal through which you arrived in Upper Exile. It's twenty feet high, glows fiery red, and makes your face tingle from here. Guards flank it to either side, and a mage with a journal stands in front of it.
It was pretty scary going through it the first time. You don't feel to enthusiastic about being near it again. It's massive surface bathes everything around it in a lurid red light.
Magical torches light this chamber. This small laboratory has the still air and thick lair of dust that indicate long disuse. The dust sparkles, however, and the knives, hammers, and other tools indicate what these chambers were used for.
This is the crystal shaping chamber. Humans borrowed many magical techniques from the Vahnatai, all of them involving various sorts of crystals. You would bet that the huge portal nearby is powered by some sort of crystal, which was probably made here.
Several small bits of crystal are kept levitating perfectly still in midair by this rune. This is probably where the stones were magically held for cutting.BThis small, guarded area is probably being used to store crystals.
This room is filled with papers, journals, booklets, maps, schedules, inventories, and people manipulating, studying, reading, writing on, shredding, crying over, and generally dealing with them. This must be where the fort's planning takes place.
This is a very bad place to cause trouble in. Massive waves of guards have no trouble disarming and hauling you off. You are immediately deemed unfit to be Exile's champion in the surface world. Your adventure ends here.
There is a round hole in the east wall, six feet up, two feet in diameter, heavily slicked with grease. There's no way to work your way up it, and it's too dark and twisty to see the end of it.
With the typical disregard for hygiene and aesthetics, the goblins have been throwing their filth, bits of rotting food, and less savory substances in here for some time. It's pretty gross.
You find the pitiful remains of what was once a human being. You see on her shoulder a scrap of what looks like a uniform of the army of Exile. It's too unpleasant to look any closer than that.xEven from here, you can tell that goblins are living to the south. The smell is too strong for anything else to be true.
The furs in this goblin lair are less rotten, the air less fetid, the scraps of food mildly fresher. This must be the lair of a goblin of great status.
This room is the least crudely constructed of anything you've seen in the goblin lair so far. It even has a cut stone floor. There is a polished stone altar in the middle of the room, which is unusually well made for goblin work.TYou utter a brief prayer or two to the goblin's dark god. Nothing happens this time.
You utter the powerful words, and focus your holy energy into the rough altar. Nothing happens. There isn't any evil power in the stone for you to affect.[When you pull the lever, you hear the clatter of movement from the portcullis to the north.
Like most settlements in Exile, this bandit lair has a small shrine. The temple is a small, dark, sleek thing. The shrine itself is dustless and claustrophobically small.
This chest has 'LOOT' painted on the top in large, crude letters. You open it eagerly, and find only dust. Maybe the bandits are dirt poor, or perhaps they moved their ill-gotten gains elsewhere...|
The bandits have been dumping their trash in this cave, a suitable distance from where they actually live. Like all trash pits in Exile, the stuff is being slow to decompose, and the stillness of the air creates an unbearable stench.
lYour head gone, the creature sews the head of a small dog on the stump in its place. Boy, do you feel silly.
This bizarre, bulbous building is clearly of Vahnatai construction. The stone looks not so much cut or shaped as grown. The walls are round, smooth bubbles of rock, with eerie, silent passages leading into it.
You only manage to open the case a crack before sparks fly from the handles and sear your hands. In the moment it was open, you saw small crystals and completely unrecognizable tools.
When you bend close to the crystal, odd magical runes begin scrolling rapidly up its surface. You concentrate hard on them. After a time, they repeat, and repeat again. However, your magical knowledge is inadequate to decipher them.
When you bend close to the crystal, odd magical runes begin scrolling rapidly up its surface. You concentrate hard on them, and as they repeat, they start to make sense to you. Soon, you figure out what they're saying. You learn the spell Major Blessing.
This chamber is so solemn and energy filled it makes the rest of Ghikra seem mundane in comparison. To the north is a smooth, deep blue pool, undisturbed the by intense flames floating on its surface.
On the other side of the pool are two heavy stone platforms, constructed by the Vahnatai to serve as homes for two of their leaders and greatest treasures: the Crystal Souls. You strongly feel you should watch your step.
You suddenly stop moving. There's no visible magical barrier here, and you don't feel any sort of heat or cold or static electricity. Your muscles simply refuse to move you down the corridor any further. You back away.
You get a little too close to the center of the runic pattern. Whether in warning or because you disturbed something you aren't sure, but a blast of energy flies out and washes over you. It hurts an awful lot.
Every hair on your body stands up as you approach the chamber to the east. It is clearly a magical laboratory, but alarming in it's spareness. There are no tables, no notes, no arrangements of vials or clutter.
There are only two cases at the west wall, and an enormous pattern of glowing runes, etched ten feet high in the tile of the floor. Above the center of the pattern the air warps and shimmers, like it does above a fire.
You reach the entry hall of Ghikra. Ghikra is not so much a town as a diplomatic settlement, where your  Vahnatai allies keep in touch with the people of Exile. It is disturbingly silent - there is an unsettling lack of guards.
The entry hall is decorated in the Vahnatai style: statues and pools arranged in a way that seems random to you, but has great aesthetic value to them. Round passages lead off into the shadows.mThe case contains hammers, knives, and other tools for the working and shaping of crystals. Worthless to you.
The passage is blocked by a wall of energy. You've developed a pretty good feel for when you can get past a magical barrier and when you can't. You're pretty outclassed here. You back away.
Suddenly, there is a burst of flame from the fire pit to the south!You shield your eyes from the bright light. When you look again, a moment later, two beings are there that weren't there before. They don't look happy ...
You approach the glowing door in the air. With a flash of light and a strange, vertiginous feeling, you are reunited with your party.
In your last few moments of life, you realize why the Vahnatai didn't need any guards in Ghikra. The Empire stole three Crystal Souls from them once; they made sure nobody could rob them again. Flames shoot from the walls, and turn you to ash.
Ghikra is now completely silent. Now that you know the Vahnatai are responsible for the horrors on the surface, you approach with extreme caution.
The chest is empty.
The chest contains several round, smooth red amulets, one for each of you. You take them and put them on. You feel a pleasant cool feeling while wearing them.
You open the chest, and find a small blue crystal with a glimmering light flickering inside it. There's something about the light that seems almost alive. You pick up the crystal and put it in your pack.oThe chest contains a beautiful steel sword, its pommel wrapped in shiny lizard skin. You pick it up reverently.
You remember what Commander Johnson told you, and say 'Galros.' Sure enough, a section of the east wall of the building slowly fades away. A corridor leads into the dark bunker. There is a peculiar, pungent smell, like boiling herbs.
New Formello is clearly a city still under construction. The walkways are only partially done, many of the buildings are incomplete, and everything finished looks brand spanking new.
Several of the insects that infest this area of Upper Exile have snuck back here. It would seem they are waiting back here to ambush whatever humans they can. It would also appear that the humans they've been waiting for are you.
You are by several huge rock pillars, which are being knocked apart to get stone to build New Formello. Rubble from the huge stone formations is stacked all about. It must have taken great effort to knock it all loose.cFrom among the huge rock pillars to the west, you would swear you can hear a soft chittering noise.
The counter in this room is covered with all manner of building tools: hammers, picks, and shovels. Very little of it is useful to you.
You spend a long, uncomfortable night, filled with strange dreams and much tossing and turning. The dampness of the room seems to get everywhere.tWhen you wake up the next morning, you feel rested, but only a little. You also feel cold, moist, and uncomfortable.
You walk into a peculiar room ... it contains only a wooden throne covered with gold leaf. It is surrounded by a pattern of runes made of carved agate, embedded in the floor. They glow slightly.
Suddenly, you notice a secret door open slightly in the south wall. The head of a middle-aged, bearded male pokes out his head and sees you. He mutters a word, and pulls his head back safely. As you prepare to charge, the runes flash once ...
You are at the entry to a magical laboratory. There is all manner of esoteric clutter piled in every corner, and strange, constantly changing smells waft through the air. One interesting thing ... many of the items have slime spots on them.
You peek into the cauldrons, and are immediately repulsed. There is slime cooking in there, one color of slime for each pot. You aren't sure whether Jordan was trying to make slime, or rendering down slimes already made.
Either way, the sight and smell makes you slightly ill. You notice the insides of the cauldron are covered with a thin layer of glass to keep the acids from the dead slimes from eating through them.
You finally reach Jordan's bedroom/library. Of greatest interest are the bookshelves on the north wall. They are covered with scrolls, on which you see dense, fresh handwriting. It's possibly very interesting.
The smell to the west is a combination of rotting flesh, old cheese, and garlic. There is a thin layer of clear, mucous-like substance on the floor. There's also several spines, dried and bent, each about a foot long.
This looks like the body of one of the fort brigands. He died from several stab wounds on his legs. Your guess: the goblins killed him and hid him here. Probably just dungeon politics.
The brigands and goblins have responsibly opted to store up a little extra food for hard times. In this cave mushrooms grow in neat rows, carefully tended by goblin lackeys.
The cabinet is filled with Erika's notes on the Vahnatai. There are drawings, biological notes, musings on their thoughts and philosophy, and many pages of _Yet Unanswered Questions._ It's all pretty technical, and you don't get much out of it.NYou find the withered body of an Empire soldier, left here to starve to death.
This chilly cave is the spider's larder. Cockroaches, ranging in size from 2 to 8 feet long, lie mummified in thick coffins of webbing, waiting patiently for a hungry arachnid to walk in and suck their insides out. Yum.
Whoever occupied these ruins before the spiders moved in, they weren't stupid. They cleaned out this treasure room before leaving.
You cut open the webbing, and a huge cockroach works its way laboriously out. Showing the thoughtfulness and kindness these creatures are known for, it attacks you immediately.
You kill the struggling cockroach with one swift blow. The spiders will be very mad at you for spoiling their feast. Spiders, intelligent or not, only like to eat things that are still alive.ZWhoever lived here emptied this chest before leaving. It has mold in it, and nothing else.
The few pieces of mostly rotted away furniture in this bunkroom provide few clues as to who built this place before the roaches arrived, and why. They used beds, and were human or human sized. That's it.
You step on the rune, and the altar begins to glow. It builds up some energy, and tries to send it over to you. However, the altar seems to detect something is amiss. The glow and the rune disappear, and guards appear.
The spiders never bothered to make their way into this small shrine, and that was probably a wise idea. This room has an odd, malevolent chill to it. Whoever first built this place had very grim taste in architecture.
This charred pit was probably used as a smelter. There are still ashes and bits of charcoal at the bottom. Nothing else, though.
A cave-in has deposited a major pile of  rock and rubble in front of this huge door. You doubt you're going to be able to get it open.
The spiders have rather ingeniously set up cockroach pens here. Ahead, you can hear hissing and smell garbage. Probably, the roaches grow up on their own and eventually wander out, where they're pounced on, paralyzed, and devoured. Clever.|You cast the spell, and easily disrupt the altar's dark energy. It manages a last defensive act before cracking, however ...
This pedestal has a small statue and memorial plaque on top. The plaque reads: _In memory of Zelaz, lost in the Fort Emergence Raid. May what's left of him find peace._
This pedestal has a small statue and memorial plaque on top. The plaque reads: _To Corinda, accidentally teleported into solid rock. We apologize sincerely._yThis pedestal has a small statue and memorial plaque on top. The plaque reads: _To Volorb, lost during routine training._

This pedestal has a small statue and memorial plaque on top. The plaque reads: _To Kricfalusi, who mysterious and suddenly dissolved._
You open the case, and find a soft velvet pad with nothing on it. The cult must not have stolen this item yet. You close the case.
This room contains a series of counters, each lined with a variety of items, some rare, some common, some quite odd. This must be where the cult places the items which they don't quite find worthy of worship.
These damp stone cells are where the members of the cult come to sit, meditate, and suffer in order to purify themselves. You're getting chilly just looking at this grim, mossy place.
This is where the cult does its training. Based on the clubs sitting on the floor, each with brownish stuff dried on the ends. Evidently, the cult trains people by having them beat each other senseless with big sticks until skills appear.
The books are on different sorts of items. One interesting one, by 'Rita of Patrick's Tower,' mentions that certain sorts of metal are filled with malevolent energies, that make one sick just by being nearby.

The crystal is dark.gYou almost receive a magical vision. However, your magical skills are not strong enough. It disappears.
You receive a vision! You see a huge lizard, undoubtedly a dragon. It casts a spell, and several large golems appear! They march off, and the vision fades. Very interesting. Anaximander should hear of this!
You kneel and offer an insincere prayer to the dark altar, more out of curiosity than anything else. Nothing happens. When you stand up, however, your hand brushes the altar. It glows red at the touch, and a monster appears.
Gingerly, you kneel at the altar again. Nothing happens. You wait. Nothing continues to happen. You can still feel dark energy emanating from the altar. It just isn't bothering with you.
You focus your holy energy into the altar, trying to break up and dispel the evil magic. You succeed ... the foul forces dissipate, and fine cracks appear all over the altar.
This large, slime coated cave is dominated by one feature: a huge pool of green goo. It bubbles and hisses ominously, and constantly emits puffs of dangerous looking gas.
As you watch, a tiny ocher slime crawls out of the green pool! It slides around a bit, and then flows back into the slime pool. Amazingly, you may have found out how the hordes of slimes are created!
This is clearly a spellbook. Unfortunately, the directions, ingredient lists, and incantations are beyond your comprehension. Eventually you wander away, unenlightened and frustrated.
The book is a spellbook, and while it's a bit esoteric and not entirely clear, you can make sense of some of it. In particular, you understand the instructions for one mage spell. You now know the spell Minor Summoning.IThe altar is still cracked, dead, and unthreatening. Nothing useful here.
Ouch! That smarts!oA spark flies from the amulet and burns your hand. You jump back, startled. Maybe you aren't meant to get this.
A small spark drifts out of the brazier when you get close, and floats away. One of you watches it, and notices that it grows larger as it floats away. And larger. And larger ...
This door has an imposing number of potent glyphs and sigils on it, and a large electrum keyhole. Unsurprisingly, the door is locked, and none of your keys work.*You suddenly find yourself somewhere else.
You draw your blades. Erika looks strangely unconcerned. As you approach, billows of flame erupt from all around you. The floor, walls, and ceiling vomit searing waves of heat upon you. In moments, the air around you is hot enough to reduce you to ash ...
... but then nothing happens. The amulets protected you! Erika looks alarmed. Then she stands, readying herself for the challenging work of killing you ...OYou pull the lever, and hear a satisfying clatter from the nearby portcullises.
You take a sip of the water. It's brackish, slightly slimy, and not at all pleasant. Nothing happens, although you feel a tiny bit queasy.gYou wash your hands in the slimy water. They come away about as dirty as they were before being washed.
A deep voice booms out _You are impure, interlopers!_ A bolt of lightning flies from one of the walls, in order to give you a little behavior modification.
Your hands tingle. A sweet smell fills the air, and little motes of light appear and dance around you. A deep soothing voice from out of nowhere says _You are clean. You may proceed._ The lights and the voice then disappear.
The padlock holding this door closed looks incredibly crude and simple. Even though the gold rune set into it implies some sort of magical protection, you're still confident you'll be able to get it open.
The padlock holding this door closed looks incredibly crude and simple. The gold rune on it, however, makes you suspect magic. You check, and indeed find that the marble key you found unlocks the padlock.
You press the button, and hear a rumbling, crackling noise from the portal chamber. You would guess that you just reenergized the portal. Maybe you can finally go home ...
You see the most sacred, well guarded room in the headquarters of this bizarre cult. It's the display chamber for their most valued artifacts. There are six alcoves, each with a large case designed to store some item.
You approach the teleporter, but then you realize you haven't yet retrieved the Orb of Thralni. If you give the cultists a chance to get away with their ill-gotten gains, it's unlikely you'll ever find them again. Regretfully, you turn away.
Holding the Orb of Thralni close, you approach the cultists portal. Hopefully, it will send you somewhere near home. As you approach, however, the portal suddenly fades and loses energy. You can no longer use it!
You turn, and see several vicious looking cultists, led by the cults massive, gaudily dressed, powerful leader. They're fully prepared to take back everything you stole, and a few more items in addition.
Nervously, you step near the cultists jury-rigged, unstable teleporter. Uttering a few quick prayers and reminding yourselves its your only route out of here, you step in. You black out, and eventually come to in ...
The portal is still there, but it's in a sort of low energy state. It has enough energy in it to still be there, but not enough to carry anyone anywhere. You have to keep searching before you can find an escape route.
sThe sliths have thrown their trash (and the bodies of several miners who weren't lucky enough to escape) back here.
To the north is some recent construction. The walls are massive, crude, and very sturdy. They were clearly built for one purpose ... they help the sinister invaders of the mine defend themselves against attackers. For example, you.
These long, low halls are all human made. They were dug out by shovels and picks, in order to work the rich veins of silver and gold ore.
TOne of the sliths ahead has a wand of fireballs, and isn't being shy about using it.
You find the Slithzerikai chief's journal. You puzzle your way through it, trying to find out what these creatures, so far unknown on the surface, are doing here. These sliths were members of a band in Exile led by the evil and mighty chief Sss-Thsss.
After Sss-Thsss was killed by adventurers, they went off into tunnels unreached by humans. After years of nomadic wandering, they found a way to the surface. After a year more, they decided to take up banditry. They came here, and the journal ends.qYou finally find a way out of this cavern. It's the bears' secret back way out, concealed by thickets and shrubs.
You move into the lair of the ursagi, the massive, sinister, intelligent bears that infest these hills. As you enter, you think you hear some of the creatures talking and moving outside. Hope you're prepared ...
As you move farther into the cave, you hear the deafening rumble of stone behind you. It's an avalanche! You dive for cover. When the rockfall ends, you look back, and see someone has rolled massive amounts of stone into the cave entrance. You're trapped!vThe farther west you go, the chillier this cavern gets. You have to be careful to keep from slipping on the icy floor.
The ursagi have the odd tendency to use goblins as slaves, servants, and grooms. (And possibly sometimes food, but you prefer not to think about that.) This is where their goblins are stored when not being used.
Several ursagi were concealed on ledges above and behind you. They leap out to ambush you. You're extremely alarmed by how fast and limber the massive beasts are. Huge teeth and claws bared, they go after you.
You built up a massive charge of holy energy, and hurl it at the strange stone structure. The structure absorbs the energy and remains completely undamaged. Whatever this thing is, it's a type of magic you're completely unfamiliar with.
Crossing your fingers and hoping you're doing the right thing, you shatter the crystal with one sure swing of your weapon. As the pieces of quartz fly across the glade, the spirit inside rises up and howls. You recognize the voice - it's Vahkohs!
_Curse you!_ it screams as it begins to fade. _Curse you! Curse you for all eterniteeeeeeee ..._ and it's gone. At last, this dark creature has been eliminated for good.
You emerge from the tomb on the other side, and find a small glade. The trees are twisted and warped, and block out most of the sunlight. In the middle of the glade is a pedestal.xYou pull the lever, and hear the clattering of distant chains you have come to associate with pulling levers in Valorim.
Interesting! The smell as the barrier chars your flesh is not unlike that of frying bacon! You back away, while you still have noses to smell with.
The vampire's writing is cramped, and his magical formulae are confusing in the extreme. Try as you might, you just can't figure his spellbook out.
The vampire's writing is cramped, and his magical formulae are confusing to the extreme. Nonetheless, you manage to eke some learning from the ancient pages. You now know the spell Antimagic Cloud.
The vampire's writing is cramped, and his magical formulae are confusing in the extreme. Fortunately, you manage to puzzle it out and figure out one of the spells. You can now cast Force Barrier.
You stare into the gloomy halls of this huge, dark stone building. Right inside is a large entry hall, with a massive, ornate, empty throne.
The halls are not empty, however. They're full of undead, wandering aimlessly about. Interestingly, they seem uninterested in attacking you. They don't even notice you.
You suddenly hear the voice of the vampire Vahkohs in your head. He says _Oh, so you thought you killed me? I'm much more cunning than that. I live still, and will torment you 'til the end of your days._ You feel very ill and confused.
You strike the final blow, and the vampire Vahkohs falls. As expected, his body begins to moulder immediately. However, something very unexpected happens. His spirit rises from his decaying form and hovers in front of you.
It doesn't make any sound, however. It just floats away through a nearby wall. It seemed too insubstantial to affect you.  Very odd. Oh well. Now that the tomb's owner has been defeated, the undead hordes in this area should fade away. Victory is yours!
You are at the west end of a massive hall. Lining its sides are statues of troglodytes, but not regular stunted troglos. They're tall, and distinguished, and each has the name of a great troglo hero at the base.
You notice that there are paths sloping upward at the far east end of the cave. You also notice that there aren't any troglodytes in sight. It's quiet. Too quiet.
You find a small, hidden temple storeroom. On the counter is a full, beautiful suit of troglodyte ceremonial armor. If you got it modified and scraped off the troglo symbols, it might make a very good suit of armor for you.
There are many troglodyte bones and skulls in this cavern. It looks like many troglos have come here to repeatedly expectorate and throw garbage on them. It's pretty gross.
There is a crater to the southeast, from which bubbles the fresh magma that flows through these caverns. Going any further southeast, even with magical protection, will result in your becoming small, blackened piles of carbon.
The giants have erected a stone platform in the middle of this cavern. It has an alabaster pedestal in the center. This must be where they place the stuff they really want well protected.
You have discovered a very old altar of unknown origin. It's very run down. The many volcanic quakes that have buffeted it over the years have cracked the floor, pillars, and altar. Basalt dust covers everything.oThe volcanic crater to the southeast constantly spits out fireballs. Unfortunately, one of them lands near you.
The altar is cracked and decayed, but the magical traps placed on it remain. Ball lightning flies forth and makes your day a lot worse.
Insubstantial shapes rise through the floor. You look around you, and see a lot of them. They're spirits and spectres, who float through the moving walls to attack you.
The portal teleports you to another cavern. The teleportation makes you feel very ill, as if you've just been flung quite some distance."The portcullis to your east opens.?You pull the lever. It makes a nice, satisfying clicking sound.
You try to walk down the passage to the west, but an invisible force stops you. Looks like yet another tedious magical barrier trap thingy.gThe moving wall smashes you into a wall. You now have a more than passing resemblance to raspberry jam.
You slay the last of the nagas. With their leaders gone, you have little doubt the other evil creatures of these caverns will wander off. No longer will this den of evil terrorize the area.
You reach a large cavern, with an arching ceiling and many scales and huge, shedded snakeskins on the ground. This is the lair of the evil masters of these caves - the nagas.
The air of this cave is icy, but the cold isn't enough to mask the smell of death from the south. There are spots of blood and scraps of clothing on the ground.ASuddenly, two milky white drakes drop onto the ledge to the west!
You catch a motion out of the corner of your eye to the west. You turn quickly, and see a large ledge, with several insubstantial humanoids hovering on it. They seem to be preparing spells.
You reach a massive chasm, with an icy draft rushing out of it. These caverns are bitter cold. A ledge leads along the edge of the chasm to the south. You can't tell how deep the chasm is.
From deep within the caves, you hear the howls of damned, tortured souls. The keens of the undead, combined with the icy temperature, make this a very unpleasant place to be.
Sulfras looks very upset that you learned her secret! She casts a spell, and alien beasts appear all around you. The Beastslayer Blade disintegrates!
When you enter this tunnel, you feel a palpable sense of uneasiness. There's something dark in this place. You look around, and quickly realize that, oddly, no animals or monsters have settled in here.
You reach a series of Vahnatai crypts, amazingly close to the surface, oppressively old, and radiating some sort of dark energy. You hear hissing and moaning in the darkness.
nThe door has a small platinum keyhole, amazingly uncorroded considering its age. You don't have the key to it.
The door has a small platinum keyhole, amazingly uncorroded considering its age. You put the platinum key you found in the keyhole. It fits. You turn it, and you hear the door become unlocked.
You reach a honeycomb of narrow twisting passages, all alike. You think you hear, just at the threshold of perception, soft whispering.
You recognize these ruins as Vahnatai architecture. However, it's of an archaic, peculiar design. It was also amazing well constructed, and probably mildly enchanted. It is still in reasonably good shape, and isn't too overgrown with moss.
The ceiling of this passage cracked and sank a bit, sticking this door firmly in place. You doubt you'll be able to get it open.
You are at the entrance to a storeroom. There are two rows of crystal Vahnatai floor boxes, centuries old and covered with a thick layer of dust and lichen.YSuddenly, with flashes of light and puffs of smoke, evil creatures appear all around you!7You step on the ancient rune, and feel a soft tingling.oYou open the cabinet, and find that whatever was originally stored in here, it mouldered into to dust long ago.
You find several crystals on pedestals. The crystals are large, blue, and beautiful, but look largely inert. You look them over, wondering if there is any Vahnatai magic residing within them, and realize there is a tiny light flickering inside each one.
As you get close, you would swear you hear whispering inside your minds. You can't make out what the voices say, but they're definitely there. These crystals must contain ancient Vahnatai spirits! The Vahnatai will be pleased to hear of this.
You enter this tower, which has been built way, way out in the wilderness. Looking closely, you realize something is odd about this place. The stone glows slightly and feel waxy, and the tower has a distinct air of unreality or unstableness about it.
Suddenly, a section of wall behind you swings out, blocking your retreat. The moving wall exposed a small alcove, which is filled with quickfire. The deadly flames immediately start to roar out after you.eThe fountain refreshes and reenergizes you. You feel some of your health being restored by every sip!
You drink the water. It tastes cool and refreshing at first. Then your skin develops massive boils, and your whole body starts to ache.pYou drink the cool, refreshing water. However, as far as you can tell, that's all it is. Cool, refreshing water.
You drink the water, and feel it bubble and slosh warmly around in your stomach. Then it starts to grow warmer and suck energy out of you. Just when you start to get really worried, it cools down and the effect fades. However, you feel drained.
You drink the water. It's flat and tasteless, and you start to feel it didn't have an effect. Then you start to feel smarter! You now know the spell Revive All.~You drink the warm, soothing water. It has a strange citric taste, and rapidly reenergizes you. Magical energy flows into you.
You finally reach the exit of this deathtrap. The portcullis ahead of you open. The stone of the tower begins to grow strangely insubstantial. The structure still exists, but it may not for much longer.
You enter the strange tower from the south. The entrance is blocked by several closed portcullises. You won't be able to get in.LYou try to move through the throne room, but an invisible barrier stops you.
You open the dragon's box. Several massive creatures appear to try to kill you. You're relieved. It could have been much worse.
This small door is solid steel, with tiny gold runes set into it. There's a small keyhole. However, you don't have any keys that fit. This is going to be a very difficult door to crack, it it's possible at all.
You suddenly hear a deep, powerful voice: _You are intruding in the domain of Sulfras the Dragon. I have no reason to see you. You have no right to see me. Depart now, before you are slain._
You suddenly hear a deep, powerful voice: _You are intruding in the domain of Sulfras the Dragon. I grant you an audience to see me. You may enter._ The portcullises to the south open silently.
You see an enormous cavern to the south, which conforms very closely to what people say Hell is like. It's a massive, swirling cauldron of sulphur, magma, and flames. In the center, you think you can make out a huge, basalt island.
The hot, steaming rock in front of you suddenly cracks, and hot magma bubbles up. You back away quickly to keep from being slain. The crack seals itself. Sulfras must have placed a magical trap here to protect his domain.
You see a golem, an enchanted humanoid-shaped creature of stone and metal. However, this golem is smaller, faster, and more lethal looking than any golem you've seen. Its face is completely featureless. It makes a troglo look friendly by comparison.
You see one of the fiercest monsters you've ever seen. It's like a six-legged pit bull, five feet high, and pure muscle and teeth. Worst, its head is able to swivel 360 degrees. It could bite you, and shred you to pieces just by spinning its head.
You see a huge pylon in the chamber ahead, which is taking in huge amounts of power from some source outside the tower. Unfortunately, there's so much energy out there you'd be fried the instant you emerged. You'll have to turn back.
You see a huge pylon in the chamber ahead, which is absorbing power from some source outside the tower. Fortunately, in looks like you could pass through the energy flying around out there with only a minor amount of damage.
Over the crackling of the energy from the pylons, you think you can hear some sort of high pitched chittering. It's as if someone on this level is speaking, and the voice is being carried through the tower. You can't understand the language.
The runes on the floor form some sort of display. They form and reform to display schematics, accounts of troop movements, and battle plans. However, they move far too fast for you to understand them. Your head starts to hurt, and you look away..The portcullis in front of you opens smoothly.
You suddenly find the bridge becoming more insubstantial under your feet. You try to move back, only to find your feet sinking slowly through it. You struggle to escape, only to find yourself sinking through faster. You don't make it back to safety ...
The bridge ahead looks slightly insubstantial, like it's not entirely there. However, a quick prod with your foot indicates it's more than solid enough to hold you.
The bridge ahead looks slightly insubstantial, like it's not entirely there. Worse, it seems ethereal in the middle. You doubt it's solid enough to hold you.
At the west end of this cavern, you see a closed portcullis. Between you and it stands a huge suit of armor. Its gauntlets are lined with razors. Before you can decide how to proceed, the suit of armor begins to move! With a creak, it lurches towards you.{An alarm sounds, and you hear loud shouts ahead of you. Whoever's in here, they know you're here, and they aren't friendly.
An alarm suddenly sounds! You stop, unsure of how to proceed, and the alarm ends just as suddenly. Someone ahead, clearly a human, yells _Come on in! We expected you. You can stay in the inn, but keep to yourself, or there'll be trouble._
The passage goes for some distance under the mountains to the north, maybe even leaving Valorim altogether. However, the route is blocked by a pair of massive, glowing portcullises. This escape route is not for you.CYou are suddenly bathed in a blue, sparkling light. You feel stiff.cA doomguard crashes to the floor. When it does, the portcullis at the west end of the cavern opens.
You hand all your gold and magic items over to the demons. Out of gratitude for your going to such lengths to free them, they let you keep your food. Then, laughing mockingly, the hellish creatures disappear.
Having been trapped for centuries, the demons are spoiling for a bit of a fight. They find your refusal amusing, and an opportunity for a bit of entertainment. The haakai summon aid, and battle ensues.
You try to back away, but you're too close and the force of the altar is too strong. Images of the other stone circles you've visited running through your minds, you approach the altar in a daze ...
You stand just outside a massive stone circle. Eight stone spires, each fifty feet tall, surround a massive, black stone altar. Your nerves sing with the desire to enter.
You get a very grim feeling. You don't know what malevolent force you've unleashed onto the earth. All you can hope is that it doesn't do too much damage. The altar starts to crack and crumble. There's nothing more to do here.
Entering, you are greeted by the smell of ozone and fresh oil, and the sound of powerful machinery. This dungeon must be filled with the Vahnatai's powerful magical machines. As you enter, dark magic energy from the machines begins to sap your strength.
To the south, you see several gleaming spires. They are the Vahnatai's strange magical machines, using energy beyond your comprehension, built strong enough to resist your assaults.VYou press the button, and there is a flash of light! You find yourself somewhere else.
Looking through the bars, you see what looks like some sort of Vahnatai quarters or safe house. This might be where they stay when traveling through here. You can't see any way in.
\The ground shudders under your feet. You hear a grinding sound from the moving floor nearby.
You taste some of the mushrooms and gruel. They are flavorless, but seem edible. You take a bit. After you remove the food, the box magically replenishes itself!4Suddenly, the floor under your feet begins to shift!
To the north, narrow passages wind through the core of the machinery. Sparks and smoke fly from the infernal devices. You aren't sure what they're for, but they seem very new. Maybe this place is a new weapon, waiting to be fired at the Empire.
This safe house has magical defenses, designed to keep people like you from using them. Magical blades suddenly start whirling through the rooms.
As you gape, a glowing shade appears in front of you. It says _As you get closer, so I can help you more. First, you must pass this machine. Work upstream. Move fast. Step careful. Buttons are the key. I await you beyond the Great Wall._ The shade fades.
You don't notice anything different after pushing the button. However, the machinery is pretty loud. If something did happen, you probably wouldn't hear it.
A rank smell makes your eyes water. You look down into a deep trough, filled with foul, acidic slime. The trough leads from a huge cauldron to the east to the chasm outside the fort to the west. Maybe the trough is here to drain off excess goo.SYou push the crystal in. There is a loud blatting noise. The crystal pops back out.
You push the crystal in. You hear a soft rumbling noise, and then the roaring and splashing of flowing liquid. Then, almost as soon as it began, the sound of flowing liquid ceases. The crystal stays in.sThe only crystal on the pedestal you could push in is still in. There's nothing else you can do here at this point.
You encounter a bunch more monsters, which throw themselves at you pitifully and mindlessly. Ghastly ichors drips from their mouths, and blah, blah, blah.
You move deeper through this strange valley, when suddenly, as tends to happen any time you try to walk anywhere, a bunch more creatures appear in order to kill you. They drool, and slither, and blah, blah, blah.mSuddenly, and without warning, a bunch of monsters appear, and there's a flash of light and blah, blah, blah.
You emerge from the valley, and see yet another in a series of the surface's interchangeable, refreshing towns. Maybe there's more people you can ask about their names and jobs!
You find the long lost, fabled Chamber of Uninteresting Monsters. Here the monsters that were underused in Exile III wait, getting resentful and waiting for someone to take it out on. 
mYou pull the lever, and you hear the now expected clattering of a portcullis, and blah, blah, blah, whatever.
You attempt to exorcise the altar, but nothing happens. Apparently, however bizarre the altar (or the cult that worships at it) is, it's not actually evil.
You attempt to leap up to the branch, but only end up falling on your duffs. You must not have the high level of specialized training it takes.bThis small courtyard contains a single, tall tree. From here you can see a sign at the base of it.
You walk carefully over the narrow stone ramp over the acid pool. when one of you slips on a damp spot and falls in! However, no damage occurs. It turns out the liquid is only water. You haul your friend out.
This is an book of learning for the apprentices of this peculiar monastery. It is titled _Being Master of the Kung-Fu of Holding of Breath._
This is an book of learning for the apprentices of this peculiar monastery. It is titled _Mighty Screw Kung Fu._ You're really not sure you like the sound of that.
This is an book of learning for the apprentices of this peculiar monastery. It is titled _When the Strings Can't Show - A Flying Tutorial, by Leslie Cheung._
This grisly room must be for the testing of initiates. There's a pool of clear fluid, with a narrow stone ramp over it. As the bottom of the pool, you see bare bones. The fluid in the pool must be acid!
You read the books. They're very detailed and educational books on a variety of martial arts styles and skills, as well as exercises for stretching and developing your muscles. You feel you will be able to put the knowledge within to good use.
You are unable to translate these books. It's a pity ... the drawings inside, of people exercising and stretching, are very intriguing.~Someone shouts an alarm! Suddenly, the corridors are filled with the alarmed yells of a host of upset and heavily armed monks.
You look down the corridors, and see quite a few of them watching you, weapons in hand. Then, in perfect unison, they chant _We are the Youth Brigade of the Heaven and Earth Association!_ Then they charge.
You use the key you bought to enter the monastery. You hear, from deep inside, the sounds of chanting and vigorous exercise. Oddly, the floor and walls show the nicks and stains of constant combat. You wonder who keeps fighting who.
You kneel before the altar, and immediately regret it. Your minds are bombarded with a host of bizarre images, of demons, and fighting creatures, and evil eunuchs. You manage to stumble away, before the images drive you mad. Your heads still spin.
This room contains the statues of fallen heroes of the monastery. Strangely, the statues were carved to reflect the wounds suffered by those commemorated. You've never seen so many statues missing limbs in your life.
This room is where the students of the monastery practice firewalking. The bones lying around testify that not all were successful.7You open the chest, and receive an unpleasant surprise.
You look in the pots, and see that whatever food originally went into them, it has been boiled down to an unpleasant, multi-colored mush. What a waste.
You find the monastery's sacred library. It looks like thousands of scrolls, filled with obscure histories, bizarre rantings, and plain old doodles. Not a lot of gripping reading./You are able to walk back to rejoin your group. This chest has been cleaned out.
As your lone champion strides forth, a voice from out of nowhere says _You have entered the sacred Hall of Duels. Now prove your Martial Art is mightiest of all!_
You reach the pad, and kneel on it. Suddenly, there are three puffs of smoke and flame above the other three pads. When it clears, you see three warriors, ready to battle you. They stand, chant _Feisty Slap of Pain_ and charge!AYou open the chest and find, in addition to treasure, a surprise.
A voice comes out of nowhere: _You enter the Hall of Duels! You may not leave until you prove your martial art is mightiest of all!_ A force throws you back.
Gouts of flame erupt from the floor ahead of and behind you. As the flames start to fade, you realize what you were seeing was several hostile creatures making a very dramatic entrance.
You stand at a narrow ledge, running around the side of a sheer pit. The pit extends both far above and below you, and the sides are far too smooth to climb. Moist, odd smelling air and loud growls rise from the depths below.
A moment ago, there was nothing to oppose you to the west. Now, all of a sudden, you see several large, pallid, lumpy, humanoid creatures. They look at you hungrily.TWith a chorus of pleasant chiming noises, many red lizards materialize to the south.
You find the aged and decayed remains of a human. The armor has the insignia of the Empire army on it. An unfortunate soldier must have stumbled into this place.
You find the body of a man, perfectly, magically frozen. The body must be a trophy - it is still in practically the same condition it was just after being decapitated by Drakos. Whoever this man was, he was truly impressive. 
He was over six feet tall, with massive muscles and a blade to match. What is most impressive, however, is his armor. It's a set of full plate armor, still as clean and gleaming as it must have been the day it was made. 
There are countless bones scattered among the stalagmites and scree of this cavern. Many of the bones are animal, but even more came from humanoids. Oddly, some of them are vibrating slightly. There must be a strange, powerful enchantment on this cavern.
You step into a dank, shadowy mausoleum. You cannot imagine how many deceased souls have their final resting place here. Bone chips crunch underfoot. The smell of rot is in the air.
A strange, draining enchantment hangs on this place, weighing heavily on your minds and weakening you. You feel the magical energy slowly leaking out of your minds. Soon, you won't even be able to cast a cantrip.
You hear an ominous grinding noise from the north and south. The walls are closing in on you! You look back, and see that the secret door behind you has disappeared. You're in trouble.
You enter Zkal's laboratory, where most of his undead are made. Rendering pots bubble happily, and long counters with herbs and tools are all ready for processed bodies to bring to unlife.NYou hear the satisfying clattering of a portcullis opening (or maybe closing).
Suddenly, walls appear to the north and south of you, moving in to crush you. They have highly unpleasant reddish brown stains on them. Looks like another of Zkal's little, highly lethal traps.
You step into the teleporter and fade away, only to find yourself ... in the same place. You would swear this is the exact same cavern you were in before. It seems identical to where you were before. Very odd.
You see one of the Empire army's most horrid and powerful shock troops - a mutant giant. It's a captured giant, magically warped and strengthened, skin reinforced with metal plates, and mind altered to be utterly loyal.
The door has a rune of protection in front of it. It would help protect the door from bashing. However, an Unlock spell should do the trick.
In this cavern, you find the ruins of a crude building. It was hurriedly built and quickly destroyed. There is an eerie, total silence. You feel as if you're being watched.
You reach the entrance to the ruin. The floor is littered with bits of armor, some of which have Empire insignia. There are no humans here. Oddly, there are also neither bodies nor bloodstains.
The passage slopes sharply downward here. It's icy cold. The mutant giants have been continuing the dig here on their own. What they are after, you can't imagine.MThis wall is clearly very odd. The excavators haven't quite reached here yet.
Despite its age, this room is still very much intact. At first, you're unsure what the pit in the middle is for. Then you see the frescoes on the walls, of men and women being thrown in, and it's suddenly quite clear.
As you look at the sacrificial pit, several creatures ooze out of it. They're gray-green slimes, and the trail of slime they leave behind is hissing and eating away at the stone.
You reach an ancient crypt. A skeleton lies on a massive marble bier, surrounded by several objects of war. A crossbow, in particular, looks promising.<You pull the lever. Nothing happens, as far as you can tell.OYou break into a mausoleum. A long row of crypts stretches out in front of you.@When you step on the rune, the doors to the north glow slightly.
You reach the bottom of a huge pit. There is a thick smell of decay. You discover the unpleasant fate of the humans who lived above - someone threw them into the pit. Their bodies are all around you.
You start to step on this section of floor. However, when your foot touches, bolts of lightning arc out towards you. You just back, and only get a little fried.
You step onto this section of floor, and are quite surprised when something bad happens to you. You suddenly find yourself somewhere else, and terribly drained to boot.FYou step in the wrong place. Suddenly, monsters appear all around you.
An invisible barrier blocks your passage. As you try to find a way around it, a strange feline voice says _Mrrr. Not yet. You aren't done yet._JYou notice that the floor tiles here have been set in a triangle pattern. 
When you reach the door, you hear a loud rumbling noise behind you. You look back, to see the east and west walls of the room receding into the floor.
This low room is designed for nothing but extreme comfort. It's warm, and hazy with hookah smoke. The floor is covered with thick rugs, piles of soft pillows, and braziers. Comfort is obviously very important to the rakshasi.
You find a prayer book, still stained with the blood of the priest it was taken from. Reading it is a highly enlightening experience. You now know the spell Word of Recall.
You find a book that seems magical in nature. Unfortunately, your knowledge of things magical is insufficient to help you understand it.|
You find a spell book. It's worn and tattered, no doubt violently ripped from some traveling mage. Only one of the spells is still legible. You now know how to cast Death Arrows.:You unroll the scroll. It says, simply, _You may proceed._
This comfortable room is where the rakshasi keep their pet cats. The room is adorned with little bags of catnip and a fine brass litter box. The rakshasi clearly dote on their little darlings.
You stand at the entrance to a dark tunnel, filled with a thick, musky smell. Bits of fur float in the air, and scratches cover the floor. You've found some sort of large, rough kennel.gYou stand at the entrance to a long, narrow, dark tunnel. There is a distinct, unpleasant rotting odor.
You reach a small cavern. The rotting smell is strongest here, and it doesn't take long to see why. At the north end of the cave, you see two human bodies, somewhat decomposed.
As you enter, several large, chittering insects walk out of the shadows and charge you! Very strange that you didn't hear or see them earlier ... they're large and noisy.
The rotting smell is, mercifully, much weaker in this concealed tunnel. You check the floor for tracks or signs of someone having been here. You don't find anything interesting. This is all very odd.
It's an ambush! As you pass through the middle of the cavern, a large group of giant insects climbs up out of the pit and charges you! Chitrachs tend to emit a constant chittering noise. Again, it's odd you didn't hear them.SThis natural stone bridge is narrow and very cracked. It's a miracle it's still up.
You reach the end of this long, hazardous tunnel - a cavern, strewn with massive amounts of rubble. As you walk in, there is a flash of light, and suddenly a horde of giant insects is facing you! Some powerful mage clearly has it in for you ...
You've cleaned out this infestation of unicorns. No doubt there are plenty of others breeding in these hills who would be more than happy to replace them.
This is interesting. In this corner, the unicorns have etched a variety of crude cave drawings in the stone with their horns. There's nothing too elaborate - mainly crude stick drawings of unicorns and humans and trees.qHowever, this sign of intelligence in creatures generally regarded as mindless animal pests is rather surprising.YThe air flowing from the east is very hot and muggy, and has a distinct sulphurous smell.
You reach the center of the unicorn nest, and are greeted with a sight which is clearly and shockingly unnatural. The rock floor to the north is molten, and glows red hot. In a cave such as this, far from any volcano, this should not be happening.
This cave is obviously regarded with great reverence by the unicorns. They have etched elaborate designs and pictographs over every non-molten square inch of stone. The heat is oppressive, and the sulphur smell makes you feel faint.
The unicorns have etched a crude, but recognizable drawing in this wall with their horns: a bunch of slimes devouring  a bunch of humans, while a band of unicorns watch in the distance. These creatures are not nearly as mindless as people think.
Gold and ruby runes form a circle on the floor. Floating above it is a cloud of glowing energy, searingly hot and powerful enough to fry anything touching it. This must be what powers the portals. You have the common sense to leave well enough alone.
These journals contain copious notes on the magic and science of teleportation, written by Ernest in a cribbed hand. They are way beyond you, although it's fun to imagine the ways you could kill yourself with the knowledge.
You step into the portal, and immediately feel like someone just tried to pull your stomach out through your nose. Your body turns inside out, and your brain bubbles. Then, just as your life finishes flashing before your eyes, you find yourself...
Someone has carved into the floor here: _Pay Ernest first._ You step over the message, confident in the knowledge that you already have.
Someone has carved into the floor here: _Pay Ernest first._ You try to step over the message, but find your feet don't want to cooperate. You fail to walk down the passage.
You stab the bubble with one of your weapons, and it immediately deflates. As is shrinks, a cloud of thick black gas rises from it and floats to the southern shore of the lava pool. Once there, it solidifies. 
One moment, there was a cloud of gas, the next, a large, jubilant demon. _I'm free! At last, I'm free!_ it howls. Then it sees you. The sight of you makes it drool with hunger. After its long imprisonment, gratitude is an idea foreign to it ...
As you crawl in, you hear Ernest's voice, though you can't tell where it's coming from. He says _It wasn't that valuable a book. Not sure why you wanted it. But it wouldn't be right for me to let you go without a little slap on the wrist, now, would it?_
You walk down the musty hallway, and find yourself in a grim, dark chamber with paintings on the walls. Suddenly, things get dark. You look back and see a wall has appeared, blocking you in! Howling, spectral laughter suddenly fills the halls ...sThis painting had crumbled and faded. Only the plaque at the base communicates anything useful. It says _Gorvifal._
You can just make out this painting. It depicts a huge man with a sword sitting on a throne. The style of clothing is completely archaic. The plaque under the painting has been pried out.+Odd. This painting simply depicts a button.
This ancient painting depicts starving peasants, groveling at the feet of a huge, muscular man. He looks down upon them with contempt. Hmm. Must have been a nice guy.
This is a painting of a large, dark tower on a promontory over the water, with many farms clustered at its base. Considering how sparsely populated this area is now, this must be a very old painting indeed.dYou press the button. It makes a satisfying click. Nothing else happens (that you can tell, anyway).
This was probably once intended to be a beautiful altar - the centerpiece of the crypt. However, several cracks and a thick layer of dust later, it just isn't that impressive anymore.
With a long, furious howl, the specter Gorvifal fades away. The crypt suddenly seems much less oppressive. One thing is for sure ... nobody is going to get trapped in here again.
There is a huge, drooling ghast sitting on the throne to the north. You tense yourself up for combat, but then you realize it doesn't seem to be about to attack you. In fact, it's just sitting there peacefully, waiting.
You hear a strange, whispering, malevolent voice. _Welcome to my crypt! I hope you enjoy your stay ... I seriously doubt you will be my first visitor ever to leave. I am quite hungry, so please hurry up and die. I haven't been fed for quite some time._ 
You hear the voice again. _Go ahead! Keep marching around! I can create servants to fight you for as long as you want. Just rest assured, sooner or later you will fall to feed the spirit of Gorvifal!_JYou back away. The little glowing person floats back down into the corner.|You take a swing at the little person. It dodges and says, in a shrill, piping voice: _Humph! How rude!_ Then it disappears.
The tiny sprite flies a few inches from your face. She looks very upset. It says in a shrill, piping voice, _Yay! Big heroes have come to rescue us! My mistress Illyree has been captured by the bad giant Guhkbar! But you can save her! I know you can!_
_There's a secret way in! Guhkbar sleeps just north of his gate. Stay away from him. He's mean! Illyree is in a cell way to the north. Sneak around Guhkbar's Cave and you'll be fine and can rescue her! Yayyyy!_ The sprite flies through a wall to the west.
You reach a large cell door next to a small window. Through the window you see a smelly, dank cell. The door has a huge, impressive-looking lock.
You reach a large cell door next to a small window. Through the window you see a smelly, dank cell. The door has a huge, impressive-looking lock. You try the giant's key, and the lock pops right open.bYou open the chest. When you do, a loud alarm starts to ring. What an unfortunate magical trap ...
You work your way down into a high-ceilinged, foul-smelling cavern. There are bits of bone and fur all over the place. This isn't a place a normal person would choose to spend much time in.
You peer through the wrought iron bars, and see a low, smoky cavern. In the distance, you hear the grunting and growls of unidentified beasts, and a host of other unnerving voices.mThe portcullis is unusually large. It would easily fit a being much bigger being than yourselves. Unsettling.
This kitchen and dining hall were probably taken over by the goblins - the tables, chairs and cooking pots were once nice, but have been wrecked by neglect, abuse, and the idle picking of many claws.
These barracks were originally made for humans ... the beds and doors are human sized. Being used by filthy, clawed goblins, however, has caused everything to decay. The beds are nightmares of filth and fleas.
You hear clanking.
This is the only room in this wrecked fort the goblins haven't penetrated. Even if they'd been able to break the door down, they wouldn't have been able to bring down these barriers.
From this side, you notice someone has placed a small bag in the crook between two of the tree's branches. You take it. It's filled with silver pieces.:You hear an ominous click from the secret door behind you.
You hear loud grinding noises beneath you, coming from ten feet ahead and ten feet behind. You leap away, but not soon enough. The whole floor folds away, dumping all of you into a winding, filthy smelling chute!
This old, slightly crumbling fort has a multitude of small, polished agates set into the outer walls. It would be quite lovely and welcoming, were it not for the skulls set on the ramparts, and the tiny globs of brightly colored slime everywhere.
The farther in you get, the more little bits of slime you see. Suddenly, you hear a loud ringing noise. The corridors echo with shouts of alarm. You lose your hopes of a friendly greeting.
With the ringing of chains and a loud, clattering crash, a portcullis slams shut to the north. You try to lift it, but the one ton grid of steel bars is firmly locked in place. You have no choice but to go deeper into the fort.
You step on the magical rune, and realize in horror that it's trying to hold you in place! With an effort, you manage to pull yourself off of it. Anything weaker would be firmly held here.gYou pull the lever. You hear a series of soft clicks and a bell chiming. Something definitely happened.
The bookshelf mostly contains heavily thumbed and grimy books on the somewhat adult subject matters that appeal to the brigands. There are also many scrolls with orders, all of them signed by someone named 'Jordan.'
Her secret uncovered, Erika reaches out to you. The amulet she gave you disintegrates. You suddenly feel you (and Exile) are in a lot of trouble.;You sleep extremely, extremely well, and wake up refreshed.
The moment you look at the first characters on the page, you start to feel ill. Rings or no rings, the book knows you are not a true member. You stumble away, feeling sick and confused. Your minds don't totally clear.
You try to understand the prayers in the book, but they're just too complicated and elaborate to understand. Maybe a bit more Mage Lore training and they'd make sense.
You read the prayers in the tome, eagerly digesting the complicated but powerful rituals. When you're through, you have learned several new Priest Spells. Great deal!
The air ahead of you shimmers. The sign to the south bears a dire warning. You have the feeling you're about to enter a very dangerous area.
You walk through the translucent barrier. It disappears. There is no sound. Nothing happens. You don't feel any different. Not the most impressive defenses you've come across.
There is a chair here, set in front of a narrow eyeslit looking down on the temple below. Someone sitting here could easily keep tabs on the parishioners as they worshipped. Interesting.
You descend into the Shayder sewers. Foul effluvia pours through grates in the roof into thick, chunky rivers of graywater. The smell is overpowering. Indescribable filth is everywhere. Sometimes you wish you had a better job.NYou try to row upstream, but the current is just too strong to go any farther.
The river starts getting faster as you head downstream. You see ahead that the roof ahead descends to meet the disgusting water. You row back upstream before your boat gets smashed up, and you drown in an unusually unpleasant way.SThere's a boat securely tied to the docks ahead. It's big enough to fit your party.PThe walkway here has crumbled into the water. You can't go any farther this way.
Several unfortunate Shayder guards were trapped in this cave by the roaches. They met an unfortunate fate, in an unfortunate place.
You see a grate in the ceiling above, with bars spaced wide apart so trash can be thrown through. Sunlight pours through, although, unfortunately, there's not much fresh air. Garbage is heaped everywhere.
You drink some of the fountains fresh, crystal water. It tingles as it goes down. You feel very refreshed. No doubt the Anama imbued the pool with some sort of healing energy. It feels like the fluid is purifying your system.
You stand at the entry to the room of contemplation. Large, ornate chairs are positioned in front of broad windows. Through each one, you can see a gorgeous, panoramic view. A beautiful fountain bubbles in the corner.
This room was created as a place for meditation and contemplation. No doubt, much thought on Anama beliefs and precepts took place here, before the roaches came.
There were lots of Anama religious texts here. Then the roaches ate them all. Only a few intriguing fragments of parchment remain.
This was a small Anama shrine. However, some large roaches picked apart the altar, bit of stone by bit of stone. There's nothing left but gravel. Very peculiar roach behavior.
This was an Anama shrine, a place for thought, discussion, and contemplation. Now it is a ruin. The walls are cracked and moldy, and you hear, off in the distance, the hissing of roaches.
Most of these books are on locks and locksmithing. There are training guides, treatises on lockpicks and their uses, and, of course, lots of fiction featuring locked doors in a prominent manner. There's at least three copies of 'Bluebeard.'
These shelves contain a host of treatises on crystals. There are books on the finding, working, and magical properties of crystals. There are also tomes on the Vahnatai. These are filled with a bold combination of pure guesswork and just plain stupidity.yYou give this book a quick look. It's called 'The Care And Maintenance Of A Proper Empire Lighthouse.' It's pretty dusty.
Whatever this room was originally used for, it's been converted into a workshop dedicated to the care and crafting of crystals. Tiny flecks of quartz dust hurt the inside of your nose.=To the north, a ramp leads steeply up to the lighthouse lamp.
@You are halfway up (or down) the ramp up to the lighthouse lamp.
You are at the top of the lighthouse tower. A fire burns in a brazier in the middle. It's clearly a magical fire. The small amount of wood in the basin is burning with a far brighter light than you would expect. Very interesting.
The books are on death, the undead, putrefaction, embalming processes, the treatment of viscera to prevent spoilage, and similar esoteric, grisly topics.YYou are at the bottom of a stone ramp circling up to the chamber where the light is kept.
You are at the entry to Northpoint Lighthouse, the sole bastion standing between the ships that circle the Isle of Bigail and the jagged rocks circling the island. However, something is not right.
The place has the stink of death, and the eerie sounds of shuffling, scratching and gurgling emerge from the shadowy halls. If it weren't for the fact the light above is going strong, you might think everyone inside was dead.
You reach the top of the lighthouse, and immediately see how it works. There are two massive, magical braziers, which take a small amount of wood and turn it into a blindingly bright, long-lasting flame.
The braziers are fed with kindling by several animated skeletons. They stumble around the chamber, wandering at random, until the fires get low, at which point one of them goes to get a stick to throw in the fire. It's an odd, but efficient setup.
You touch the chest, and it sends a massive jolt of frost up your arm. Your skin is covered with frost. Eventually, you get circulation to return, but it really stings. The chests are clearly well guarded.
You reach a large cavern, filled with massive heaps of fragrant filth and wandering, happily chatting cockroaches. They don't seem to be about to attack you. In fact, they yell _Hi!_ to you when they see you.
At first, the happy, chirpy voices you hear ahead make you think you've found another colony of friendly spiders. Then the smell of garbage and filth hits you, and you realize that this place is inhabited by roaches. Happy, friendly roaches.
At long last, the ogre has taken more punishment than it can withstand. It falls to the ground with a mighty thud. Almost immediately, the dryad's grove seems brighter and cheerier.
You step into the flowers, and sweet pollen rises from them. The scent fills your nostrils, making you feel happy and groggy. Then you fall over. You wake back up at the entrance to the grove, but your head doesn't entirely clear.
You look into the grove to the south, and see a field of beautiful poppies, all of them fresh and in bloom. Their scent reaches you, makes you feel light-headed. Your vision gets blurry.
You carefully pick a few pods off of the powerful poppy plants. You're careful not to break any of them, knowing that doing so would unleash a big cloud of sleep inducing pollen.
You run up and hurl the poppy pods into the groggy ogres face. Startled, it inhales sharply, and gets the pollen in both nostrils. It reels backwards, and falls into an incredibly sound sleep.
It's apparently a very light sleeper. The moment you set foot inside its glade, it begins to stir. Looks like you'll have to take it on.
You reach a shadowy glade. There's something very cold and unwelcoming about this forest, as if a malevolent force has taken care of it. In the glade, you see a gremlin. It doesn't attack, however. It just stares at you.
You walk out through the glowing trees, and find the dryad Esselare waiting for you. She walks up and kisses you on the cheek. _Thank you!_ she says. _Thank you for saving my home!_
With a cheery nod to the rest of you, she walks off into the wood. You try to see where she went, but realize that the forest has started to shift. The trees seem different every time you look. The dryad's grove is no longer welcoming visitors.
You try to find your way out through the trees, but can't. You hear the voice of the dryad outside the glade. She says, in a soft, caring voice, _I'm sorry. My glade must be saved. I can't let you leave until it is._ 
A chill runs down your spine as you walk through the glowing trees. You find a small, twisty path on the other side. When you look back, though, you realize that the forest seems to have changed. You no longer know the way back.
This is the opening the gremlins in the grove were waiting for. Knowing that the creature won't wake up, fifty of them run out, bind its arms and legs with thick leather thongs, and drag it off to a horrible fate. The grove has been freed.
This close, you can see that the lava river here has several small stepping stones across. If you head directly east, you may be able to cross undamaged.
This close, you can see that the lava river here has several small stepping stones across. If you head directly west, you may be able to cross undamaged.
This cave is where all the lava bubbles from the ground. It's also the lair of a family of drakes. The proud parents have chosen this place to raise a brood of squirming, fire-breathing little ones. Of course, baby drakes are always hungry ...
At the top of the ramp, you find another huge hall. The cavern is a little bit smaller than the one below, and much more interesting. To the east, you see a massive altar. 
It's an enormous slab of carved basalt, 10 feet wide and six feet high, putting off energy that you can feel from here. This is where troglodytes come to be blessed and energized before going off to kill humans.
You open the troglodyte prayer book and start reading. Whether it's their god striking you down or simply a magical trap laid by the troglodyte shamans you aren't sure. What you are sure about, however, is the effect ...
You kneel before the powerful altar, hoping to absorb energy like the troglodytes do. Alas, the altar is powerful enough to tell the difference between them and humans. It does pour energy into you. Enough to turn you into dust.
This room contains a second altar. This is not the altar used by the general troglo populace. This is where the shamans and khazis come. It's a smaller, simpler slab of stone, but the energy you feel is purer, more concentrated, and just as lethal.
The altar contains a massive amount of energy - enough to make you doubt your ability to disrupt it. However, this amount of power is very difficult to keep in balance. You perform the ritual, and watch, satisfied, as the altar explodes.
When the flames clear, however, the altar is still there! You are alarmed, until you realize that while the stone is intact, its unholy energy has almost entirely dissipated. Unfortunately, before losing its power, the altar activated its defenses ...
The moment you begin to cast the spell, the altar begins to summon a powerful agent of darkness to defend it. It has finished coalescing about the time you complete the spell. The altar is destroyed. Now you may be as well.
You reach the sole chamber of the hermit's hut, a single adobe dome with a tile floor. A simple altar is set up by the north wall, and junk is scattered all throughout the room. It smells like its occupant hasn't been out for a while.
You slay Marjorie. Unfortunately, now that the manse is without a keeper, the Curse of the Manse takes effect. You turn into pigeons. It's very peculiar.
You camp out in the bedroom, and have a very relaxing sleep. The next morning, Marjorie grumpily brings you breakfast. It's truly satisfying sleeping somewhere that's not outdoors or an inn.
Marjorie walks up to you, looking concerned. _The ghost of Hawke is wandering the halls again. Could you go deal with it? I have veal to tenderize!_ She stomps back to the kitchen.
Marjorie, looking very irked, tromps out to speak with you. _The ghost of Hawke has been walking the halls again. You go talk to him. I have all sorts of dusting to catch up on!_ She tromps off.
Marjorie runs up to you, looking flustered. _There's a basilisk in the pantry! I was lucky to get out of there alive. Could you go kill it please?_ She walks shakily back to the dining hall.
Marjorie walks out to greet you. Of course, it's not a friendly greeting. _Welcome back. By the way, there are rats in the storerooms. Killing things isn't my job._ She walks off.
You are at the entrance to a secret passage between the two bedrooms. You aren't sure why it's here, but you're sure the reason was very interesting.AThis is the spare bedroom. If you want, you can have guests over!
You look through the books, hoping some sort of valuable scroll or tome is among them. Instead, you find tedious fiction, dictionaries, and outdated encyclopedias. Looks nice, at least.
You walk, for the first time, into your new home. You see a beautiful foyer, with an arching roof and a tiled marble floor. You pause for a moment to appreciate the splendor of it all. Your adventures have truly paid off.
Then, suddenly, an old woman walks into the foyer, humming and pushing a broom. She looks you over, unimpressed, and says _Oh great. More people to mess up my nice floors._ She walks by, into the dining hall to the north.
The pedestal is surrounded by dozens of crystal shards. You pick up a few of them. Maybe someone at Fort Emergence will be able to tell you something about them.
You slay the dragonling, one of Athron's brood. You can hear, even from here, Athron's cry of anger and grief. With a flash of light, all of Athron's other children disappear to safety.
You stand at the entrance to the lair of Athron the dragon. The cave has the expected claw mark-ridden floor covered with scattered, dried scales. A thick lizard smell hangs in the passage.
Some of the claw tracks, however, were made by smaller lizards that a full size dragon, and some of the scales are smaller and softer, as if they came from a baby dragon. Athron's broodlings may well be about. You hope they aren't hungry.
You approach the barrier. It flashes red as you get close, and seems to grow more powerful. You aren't sure how to get through it.
You approach Athron the dragon's magical barrier, designed to give the mighty creature the privacy it craves. As you get close, a small gap appears in it. It would appear that you are, if not openly  welcomed, at least allowed to enter.
You open the box, and a high pitched keen echoes through the caverns. Your attempt to steal from a dragon may be about to have a grisly result.
You pull one of the books off the shelf and flip it open. Unfortunately, you have the ill luck of picking a book with a magical rune of protection inside. You find yourself somewhere else ...
You find a book of prayers, and, what's more, it's a valuable one! You pick through it carefully, memorizing the intricate rituals and chants. Reading it, you learn the spell Avatar.
Lightning arcs across the passage ahead of you, keeping you from moving forward. Whatever tomes or treasures are beyond here, Khoth doesn't want you to see any of them.
You find a series of tomes, each describing a different sort of magical item. Browsing them, you learn a great deal about the sort of artifacts adventurers can find. One of you gets a higher Item Lore skill.
You find a book of arcane rituals. You browse through it, looking for spells, but the more you look, the harder a time you have stopping. Eventually you pull yourself away, but not before the bizarre acts and beings described make you feel deranged.
You find a book of prayers, and, what's more, it's a valuable one! You pick through it carefully, memorizing the intricate rituals and chants. Reading it, you learn the spell Ravage Spirit.
You cross over the bridge into the lair of Khoth. He is reputed by legend to be a secretive character, craving knowledge above all else. Farther in, you see bookshelves filled with thousands of arcane tomes, maintained and fetched by undead shades.
You find a book filled with puzzles. They're strange, complicated puzzles, illuminated in gold paint on black pages. The more of the puzzles you see, the more they confuse you, and the more of your thoughts they occupy. Eventually, you put the book down.
You find a very useful book of Alchemical concoctions. One, in particular, seems useful to you. It's a recipe for a Potion of Clarity, made using Holly and Graymold. You can now make it.
You find a recently inscribed series of scrolls, describing a spell to enchant a blade to make it work better against something called an Alien Beast. You can't cast the spell, but you memorize the ritual so you can relay it to Sulfras.
The entrance to this subterranean fort is blocked off by a truly massive portcullis. Dozens of two inch thick steel bars, set close together, make it clear that forcing your way in isn't an option. Unfortunately, nobody seems likely to let you in.
This entry to this subterranean fort is blocked off by a truly massive portcullis.  When you get close, the bars slowly rise up into the ceiling. Someone or something decided to let you in.
You find a book that seems to contain some sort of magical instructions. Unfortunately, you can't make any sense of them. Casting a spell you don't understand is always more dangerous than not casting it at all. You replace the book on the shelf.
It's bright, pleasant and sunny, and birds chirp overhead. You find, in this very implausible location, a large, lovely stone house. Nobody could get up here without flying - there aren't even footpaths.
When you open the drawer, a rune suddenly becomes visible on the front of the drawer. There is a flash of light, and you feel somewhat funny.
You enter a moist, dank cavern, located far up in the mountains. The only way anyone could get up here is by flying. The floor is marked with massive scratches, and huge discarded scales are everyone. It's no mystery what sort of creature lives here.
You stare at the tower's main power source. The tower is built over a large natural fumarole, and large pieces of odd machinery are set up to drain off the heat and use it to power the factory above.9You hear the sounds of portcullises closing to the south.
When you approach this home, a familiar insubstantial shade appears to you. It says _Welcome to the home of Bon-Ihrno. Come in, please, quickly._ Then it fades.
When you approach this home, a familiar insubstantial shade appears to you. It says _I am Bon-Ihrno. I wished to help you, but can no further. As much as I loathe Rentar-Ihrno's actions, your killing of the Crystal Souls harmed my Vahnatai spirit._
You emerge to see a hideous sight. Bon-Ihrno has been slain, cut down by one of his own people. His killer stands over him, wiping a waveblade clean. A Keeper nearby says _So goes it for traitors to our cause._
The blademasters look up to see that you have emerged. One of them says _Ah, yes. You are being here, and being about to die. Let us battle now, and at last._ Grimly, the Vahnatai trod through poor Bon-Ihrno's blood to engage you.yThe case contains some of Bon-Ihrno's personal effects: robes, crystals, and the like. You respectfully leave them alone._This is Bon-Ihrno's supply room. You have little doubt that he would like you to help yourself.
_The fortress of Rentar-Ihrno is to the southeast. I will say only this: three fluids do little, but unleash all four, and the blast will ruin all. Farewell. I return to my grieving for our lost guardians._ The shade disappears.rIt's tempting to rest again, but now that the Vahnatai know you're here, it would probably be a fatal proposition.
You step into a small treasure room. The goods the dead assembled in life are stored here. Unfortunately, as you enter, you hear an ominous rumble from the cave entrance.
You enter a crypt, where the Vahnatai have respectfully laid some of their dead to rest. The cavern is dark and icy, and the smell of death is as strong here as on a battlefield.
As you pass this small stone bunker, you notice that the passage feels strangely warm. You touch the stone wall, and it's searing to the touch! Something very hot must be inside.
You read the small note. It says _The monsters are too much. We're gone for good. If you're here, go ahead and use the shack. Store stuff if you want. Just don't tear anything up, please. Good luck. - Vlastok_
You've stumbled upon a small, cozy home up in the mountains. It's been abandoned. Everything is coated with dust. Clearly, nobody has been here for weeks. You think it's a safe place to camp.
Amazingly, someone has left a small spellbook here. It's chained down - its owner probably left quickly. It's very odd and garbled, but you manage to decode some of it. You learn the spell Magic Map. The rest of it is far too incoherent to understand.
Amazingly, someone has left a small spellbook here. It's chained down - its owner probably left quickly. It's very odd and garbled, almost completely incoherent. It'd take a very knowledgeable mage to make any sense of it.hYou have a nice, peaceful rest in your secluded mountain cabin. You wake up the next morning, refreshed.
You just walked by some things that looked a lot like gopher holes. Unfortunately, they weren't. Slimes ooze out of them, bubbling and hissing merrily.
This hotel room looks like it has been lived in for some time. Robes hang neatly on the wall, knick-knacks cover the dresser, and the bed is unmade.
You have just broken into someone's house. Much to your relief, no alarms sound, and nobody attacks you. This is not something you should count on in other towns, however ...
This house has been abandoned for some time. Dust covers every surface, and there are spider webs everywhere. Odd ... the webs are a bit thicker than you might have expected.
Curse those magical traps! When you pick up the pouch, a loud shriek echoes through the town. Worse, you hear an ominous click from the secret door you came through. Nearby guards emit bloodthirsty shouts. Uh oh.
When you pass through the gate, you are attacked by a cloud of dust. It assails your eyes and lungs, gets caught in your armor, and makes the inside of your mouth taste like mud. Piles of ore are scattered everywhere, and the air is gray.UWelcome to Pergies, mining capital of Krizsan Province. You can hardly wait to leave.
This is a storeroom for processed ore. Crates and barrels of charred rock wait to be dealt with, probably by one of the smelters outside of town.
The walls of this village are pitted and crumbled, and none of the buildings inside are left standing. The land is dead. The slimes must have overwhelmed this town at last. The stench of death hangs heavy in the air.]You see a skeleton, perfectly cleaned of flesh. This may be the remains of the house's owner.
It looks like the slimes slipped inside this house somehow. The results weren't pretty. Everything is covered with slime and decaying.
You enter the house, and see a woman and her child, sitting down to a very meager meal. They are emaciated. Your entrance first terrifies, then angers them. They scream at you to leave, and you comply.
This room is just plain odd. First, it's strange that the stable has a secret room in it, and that it's in perfect condition. Second, the walls are completely new, and have a strange, waxy feeling to them. The floor has marble tiles. Bizarre.
You find a spot where it looks like someone buried something recently. You dig, and find a box which has been smashed open. There's nothing here anymore.
Your gorge rises as you realize what is scuttling before you. It's an enormous cockroach. It's huge, and filthy, and makes a constant hissing noise! Slimes are one thing, but you can't imagine living someplace infested with these things!
At the end of the dock, a ship waits to take intrepid adventurers to far off lands. Unfortunately, you don't have a ticket. A sailor tells you to buy one from Vok.
The trip is uneventful, except for a serious, wracking attack of seasickness. Years in Exile have left you very leery of voyages on the open sea. Eventually, mercifully, you arrive ...
The grizzled old ferryman takes your tickets and lets you on board. The boat ride is quick and uneventful. You arrive in Farport.wThe ferry back to Farport and the Valorim mainland is docked here. Alas, you don't have a ticket. The sailors mock you.
This shrine is kept immaculately clean and neat, a sort of defiance of the filth and disorder that prevails in so many other places on the Isle of Bigail.
This house has been abandoned. The roaches have taken over. Cockroach droppings are everywhere, and a dried up cockroach husk, over 2 feet long (not counting the antenna), lies on the bed.
You open the top drawer of the dresser, and interrupt several cockroaches who were in the process of getting intimate. The creatures had compressed themselves to a remarkable extent to fit themselves in the drawer. They're much bigger now.
You take the boat ride to Sharimik. Then, when you get there, a band of soldiers meets you at the dock and forbids you to enter. Since the troops won't let you disembark, the people on the ship have no choice but to take you back.
This house was speedily abandoned. Everything is dusty and in disarray. After a few minutes, your keen adventurer's senses pick up the very faint smell of death and decay.
You find a hidden crawl space, filled with human skeletons. You can't tell who they were, or how they died. However, some of the scraps of clothing look like the loose garb sailors tend to wear. Whoever the killer was, he, she, or it is gone now.
A crude, low wall runs along the north end of town, defended by alert guards. They are still in the process of building walls to the east and west. The wall looks newly built - the town must have been attacked.
You take the boat across to the Isle of Bigail. The sailors seem glad to get work. Before long, you arrive in the mighty city of Shayder.
Olga quickly and efficiently bundles you across the channel to the ruined town of Kneece. She says _I keep an eye on the city. When you want a ride back, go to the end of the middle Kneece dock and wait. I'll be along._qYou see Olga's boat, waiting to serve as a ferry to the ruined city of Kneece. Unfortunately, you have no ticket.
Someone has erected a dark stone bunker in the middle of this ruin. The walls are about 30 feet high. You look down the passages to the north and east, and see lots of shadows and basalt rock. 
You hear a gentle, soothing chime. A voice, coming from midair, says _Your approach has been approved. Please proceed in safety._
You reach the center of the bunker, and find a small, cozy house, set up with crates of supplies. Someone could live out here (modestly) for some time. The scent of incense hangs in the air.
When you start to look at Purgatos' bookshelf, the titles of the books start to warp and fuzz out. You all develop splitting headaches. You move away, before any other defenses manifest themselves.`You hang around for a hour. Sure enough, Olga comes by in her boat, and takes you back to Kuper.tNerves on edge, you pass through the barrier. It ripples and parts to let you through. Nothing bad happens. For now.
This rank pen is used to keep not farm animals but wolves. Maybe they're here for show. Maybe they're shipped somewhere to be used as animal guards. You may never know.#This storeroom is currently unused.
You ride across the channel on the boat with 10 other people. The boat springs three leaks on the trip, and near-capsizes once. You've faced a lot of monsters, but none were scarier than this boat ride. You finally arrive in Softport.
You land in the middle of a pile of rubble on a raised platform. When your vision clears you look around, and see many heavily armed and unpleasant looking men and women staring at you. It doesn't take long for them to realize you're an intruder. 
You search the chest, hoping to find hints of the identities of your ambushers or the location of the stolen Orb of Thralni. You only find rather mundane supplies.
Merchants stopping here must carry a variety of valuable metal ore. It's all kept in here, each pile carefully labeled, and all of it under the constant, piercing gaze of enormous guards.
The Golddale Mining Company stores tools and some freshly mined ore in this low, dusty office, where it's kept under heavy guard.
The town of Gidrik has fallen to the continuous depredations of the troglodyte hordes. Fireballs and shockwaves have left their signatures on the ruined buildings.
This temple is unusually lovely and carefully built for a shrine in a backwater town. The floor is precisely cut marble, and mosaics decorate the walls. Building it must have been quite expensive.
There are fishermen here who can ferry you to the Isle of Bigail, but only if you get a ticket. They tell you that you can get tickets from Terry, although you may want to think twice - _The Isle is full of weirdos._
The trip across the channel is quick, although the fishy smell that hangs over the boat makes it seem much longer. Soon you are deposited on the Fenris Port docks.
This house seems to be owned by someone who's a slob in the extreme. Clothes are littered everywhere, and the floor is in extreme need of sweeping.
You take the boat ride across to the tiny town of Lost Isle. It's a quick, pleasant trip. You see dolphins. The ferryman tells you to go to the end of the center dock and wait when you want to return.
This is where you catch the ferry south to Lost Isle. The sailor who's running the raft today says you can buy tickets from Vincent in the inn.
This home looks like it was abandoned in quite a hurry. All of the furniture is still here, and a meal was even left to rot on the table.
The fixtures of this shop show the signs of heavy use, so you know this store has been used. However, it's abandoned now. It's chilly and dusty, and the shelves behind the counter are bare.
An Empire soldier sits at the table, having a good solid meal. He is displeased at being interrupted, and furious that you would break into his house. He draws a sword in order to teach you a bit of a lesson.
The trip to Gebra takes a while - you have to sail around Gorst Island to get there. When you land, the fishermen say _Come back to the boat and wait. Next time we're by, we'll take you back. And watch out - the people in Gebra are odd._ Then they leave.
There is a fishing boat at the end of the dock, with a sign saying _Gebra ferry_ on the prow. You approach, and they say if you want to take a trip, to speak to Laika.
This dusty room is filled with crates filled and shelves laden with piles upon piles of old stuff. Some is junk, some very useful looking. It would take quite a while to sort through it. None of it is yours.
You wait for a few hours, and eventually a fishing boat from Storm Port swings by. You wave them down, and they give you a ride back to the mainland. You bid a happy farewell to this odd island, and its odd people.
The chest contains papers. Lots of them. They are covered with dense, handwritten rantings. You can't make much sense of them. They seem to involve avoiding the End Times, strenuous self-denial, and the phrase _Feisty Slap of Pain._
You open the door, and see a room with a half dozen thin sleeping mats. There are monks sitting on several of them, chanting, meditating, and performing complicated and demanding stretching exercises.
Your relief at only finding a bunch of monks instead of bizarre monsters is short lived, however. The moment they see you, they emit high shrieks and charge.
This was Gorst's barracks. They're abandoned now. They're also filled with the thick, nausea-inspiring stink of death. It's very unnerving.
You dig up the box and look inside. There's a nicely sized pouch of silver coins inside. Even better, there's also a pair of fine leather gloves, which look as good as new.
The fishermen return you to Libras. They troll for salmon on the trip, making it several times longer than it needs to be. It's a long, tedious trip, but you eventually arrive.
The odor of death and decay still hangs over Aminro, and a few stray vultures circle overhead. A final troglodyte assault did the town in. The silence is grim and oppressive.
You have reached the mining town of Aminro. The walls are thick and the guards are many, and it doesn't take long to see why. Everything shows the signs of frequent and savage troglodyte assaults. It's hard to see this town lasting too much longer.
You are at the entrance of a low, nondescript bunker, with thick walls and heavy doors. Someone has done a lot of building to maintain his privacy.
You open the chest, and find it completely empty, except for a few crumbs. Very odd. You close it, and hear a strange high-pitched giggling behind you. You turn, but as you do, you start feeling very groggy.bAs you stumble and lurch about, the gremlins who appeared out of nowhere start inching forward ...uThis room is suspiciously nondescript. There's just a neatly swept, bare floor with a small wooden box in the corner.
You enter the city of Angel's Rest. The cracked walls and jumpy guards mark this small town as a primary troglodyte target. The smell of sulphur hangs over everything.
You walk into the shattered streets of the former town of Bengaro. The buildings are wrecked, thoroughly and exuberantly smashed by the hill giants.
You see an interesting looking scroll, silver runes inscribed on black leather. You pick it up and look at it briefly. Unfortunately, you find yourself unable to resist reading it. When you finish, it disappears, and you have company.yYou open the slender box, and find that someone, for whatever reason,  buried a small statue of a big bug in this stable.
You enter the town of Dellston. It was once a town with a bright future, rapidly growing. Then the hill giants arrived. Now, unless something is done, it won't be long until this town is smashed to pieces.gYou enter the town of Dellston. The place has been utterly wrecked. The hill giants have been and gone.
There is a secret passage between the two abandoned shops. It looks like, before becoming refugees, the store's owners decided to try to hide some of their stuff from the hill giants.WThis store has been abandoned. Probably not an unwise choice on the part of the owners.
You enter the town of Poulsbo. The constant bombardment of thrown hill giant rocks has finally had its desired effects. The town has been abandoned, and the buildings ruined by rampaging giants.
You enter the village of Appleton. It has been abandoned to the hill giants. It looks like no humans have been here for weeks. Many hill giants have been here much more recently.
There are plenty of books on this bookshelf. They've all been shredded - chopped up by knives. It looks like a human did it, probably to keep the giants from having them. You do find one undamaged scroll, however:
_The giants cannot read this, so I leave it for humans. My treasures will stay in human hands. My beautiful shield is hidden. It's outdoors, directly north of town. My fine helm is hidden, behind the tiny mountain. Take them, and avenge us._
It looks like the village of Malloc was hit by a quick surprise attack by someone very large and nasty who threw a lot of big rocks. The buildings have been destroyed. Hopefully someone survived.
You approach an isolated inn. It would be nice to have a bed and a warm meal. However, something is very odd. The inn has been abandoned, and one end of it has caved in. Everything is deathly quiet. You feel a chill. It's very odd.
You find an intact bedroom. It might have been a comfortable place to rest. However, there is a distinct, chilly feeling to the air of the room. You can't rest here.yThe giants have thrown a lot of the bodies of the inhabitants of Appleton in this building. It's a horribly grisly sight.
You find an intriguing book on the identification of magical items. It mentions the peculiar Wand of Carrunos. It's meant to make hunting more interesting, by making any monster it's pointed at stronger.
You find a book: 'Metallurgy for Dummies.' It mentions that certain metals are highly magical and dangerous ... merely having them around will cause the bearer to grow ill and die.
You find a variety of notes and drawings of strange creatures, which look a lot like huge, six legged pit bulls. They are called 'Alien Beasts,' and are described as being found near the Keep of Tinraya. They look very fierce.
Interestingly, the inn has a small hidden passage leading in and out of the town. Whatever purpose it was built for, you are willing to bet it wasn't legal.
You enter the house, and meet a group of Empire soldiers. You start to greet them, but then notice the torn up state of their armor and the disrepair of their weapons. These must be renegades!
Many Empire soldiers have deserted in the face of the waves of monsters. The penalty for doing so is a slow, painful death. That is probably why these soldiers are so nervous, and why they attack you instantly.
This town is on the verge of becoming a ghost town. Wainscotting is a port town, a place for ships to stop, load and unload supplies, wait out storms, and resupply. Unfortunately, few ships have been sailing lately, so things here are very, very quiet.oThe storeroom is mostly empty. There are cobwebs, spiders (which are not giant, and don't talk), and much dust.
You enter the ruins of the town of Bremerton. This town is far from the giant's fortress to the south, but the massive creatures have finally gotten out here. This town's weak defenses had little hope.
You enter Mernia, a river port town. Fresh lumber from the north is brought down here, in order to be loaded onto ships and hauled off to wood starved parts of the Empire. Alas, the attacks of the monsters have all but shut the place down.MWhoever owned this shop has abandoned it. Doesn't seem like an unwise choice.
Massive piles of lumber have been stacked here, waiting to be loaded onto ships heading north. Everything is very dusty - since no ships are allowed to go from Valorim to the rest of the Empire now, the lumber is just sitting here.
You hear the shouts of guards, and the clatter of armor. The town must be under attack. You look around to see where the attack is coming from, but nobody is coming through the gates.
Then you realize everyone is heading towards the water. You look east, and see golems walking out of the river! The faceless stone and metal creatures approached the city from under the water.
You reach the town of Greendale, a logging community nestled in at the west edge of the dense Monoroe Forest. Unfortunately, this town has been hit hard by the golems. Most of the buildings are ruined, and Empire soldiers are the only people in sight.
You reach the town of Greendale, a logging community nestled in at the west edge of the dense Monoroe Forest. Unfortunately, it has been abandoned by both citizens and soldiers. The golem attacks must have been too much for it.
You quickly row away from the destroyed island. It provided a useful and grim reminder than it doesn't take something exotic like a golem or a slime to lay waste to the countryside.cYou leave your boat behind. If you ever want to return to the mainland, go to the end of this dock.
This was once a pretty decently sized town. However, hordes of undead have been busily taking the place apart, brick by brick. The bones scattered about indicate that not all of the beings who lived here were lucky enough to escape.
This is yet another city, destroyed a few years back and increasingly overgrown. Someone has erected a small, black basalt fort in the middle of the town. It looks like it was just plopped down onto the town, crushing the buildings underneath.
You reach a grim basalt temple, dripping with foul ichor and the residue of dark rituals and foul evilness. The dead walk evilly towards you, hoping to pull you down into their eternal torment. Bummer.
One of the books on the bookshelf is still intact! For some reason, none of the undead have touched it, and it has survived the exposure to the elements as well. It has a gold ankh embossed in the cover. You pick it up and look at it.
 It is a prayer book, lovingly and intricately illuminated. Fortunately, you understand the language! Most of the healing rituals are simple and uninteresting, but one is powerful in the extreme. You can now cast Resurrect.
It is a prayer, book, lovingly and intricately illuminated. Unfortunately, the language is not one you understand. You look at the pictures. Most of them depict various sorts of healing. After a moment, you feel oddly compelled to replace the book.
You reach the fortress city of Tevrono. This highly defended town is a model of efficiency, especially compared with the wreck that is the rest of Valorim. Neatly uniformed guards and dervishes march precisely about, keeping a careful watch for golems.
You notice the city walls have metal sheets, leaning in over this town. They are heavily pitted and scarred - they must be there to block the fireballs the golems have been lobbing over the walls. Body parts from slain golems adorn the walls.uYou have a very good rest. Surprising, considering the constant yells and fireball detonations you hear from outside.
The bookshelf contains several dozen books on tactics, some of them by General Baziron himself. They look like they've been heavily read and reread.
You find a series of accounts and records kept by General Baziron. They chart the course of the war with the golems. He has had remarkable success, although he writes frequently of his lack of sufficient strength to find and assault their fortress.
IYou try to move through the doorway, but an invisible barrier blocks you.jYou find something that seems like a spell or prayer book. You try to understand it, but it's too obscure.tYou find a small, hand-written spell book, written by someone named Zalifar. You learn how to cast the spell Flight.
~You find a thick prayer book. It is beautifully illuminated, on thick vellum pages. From it, you learn how to cast Raise Dead.
This book is on the analysis and identification of items. There are hundreds of diagrams, tests, and lists of properties. You can now cast the spell Identify.
These books are on alchemy. Most of the recipes regard the curing of warts, the frightening of squirrels, and other irrelevant things. One page, however, interests you greatly. You can now make a Potion of Clarity.wYou find a small prayer book. It is tiny in size, but considerable in power. From it, you learn how to cast Revive All.
You enter the village of Draigoth, once a major waystation for merchants and travelers in and out of Valorim, now a ruin. Monsters cut through this place like a scythe, leaving little but rubble.tAll of the books that were here have been partially or wholly devoured by the alien beasts. You find nothing useful.
This house is filled with the stink of death. The floor is covered with filth and a network of deep claw marks. A den of alien beasts has been living here for some time. 
You enter the ruins of the town of Manara. It's is littered with the skeletons of the fallen. However, you are surprised to note that many of the skeletons are the remains of alien beasts. The bones are covered with a thin layer of goo.
You entered the ruined town of Ovdipur. The alien beasts have attacked the buildings with their usual thoroughness and fervor. Oddly, none of the creatures are around. The town is completely still and quiet.
Miraculously, one of the books on the bookshelf is still intact. It's a rather old prayer book. Fortunately, you're able to translate two of the prayers inside. You learn the spells Firewalk and Cleanse.
Miraculously, one of the books on the bookshelf is still intact. It's a rather old prayer book. Unfortunately, you can't quite decipher the archaic writing.
There were plenty of books on these shelves. Now there's lots of shredded paper. The beasts thoroughly masticated this library.
Suddenly, you hear a series of loud, warbling howls. From all around you. A lot of loud, heavy creatures are converging on this town very quickly. You seem to be at the business end of an ambush.
When abandoning these towns, the Empire wizards set several traps, designed to ensnare and slay some of the marauding beasts. They have been cunning enough to avoid the snares. You have not.
You step on a nearly invisible rune, which flashes brightly. Suddenly, from all directions, you hear the sounds of roaring flames and screaming beasts. A hot wave of sulphurous wind hits you. This town is now a very unsafe place to be.
Wyvern pass was a small mining town, and this building was meant to store the efforts of its people's labors. The humans are gone, but, pleasingly, some of the loot remains.
You find a small port town, far, far out in the wilds of Valorim. It looks, on the surface of it, like it's been abandoned. No people walk about, and everything is eerily quiet.
You pass around and drink the wine. It is excellent, dark and rich. You only drink a little, to keep your senses from being dulled. As the strange fanged creatures appear, however, you immediately begin to feel weak and groggy ...
Erox is odd enough that you post a guard. However, as the night wears on, your senses dull, and you find you cannot hold up your eyelids. You fall into sleep, a sleep so deep, in fact, that when the creatures come in and kill you, you don't even notice.|It's hard to relax completely in this grim place of death, but the bed is soft and comfortable. You manage to get some rest.|This shop has been abandoned. It's completely bare. There is an odd, sweet smell in the air. You can't immediately place it.
You open the door, and come face to face with a strange creature. It's humanoid, about your size, but has the head and claws of a tiger. Alerted, you look around, and see that there are suddenly several of the creatures in here with you! 
This room is neatly made up, as if the maid had been in just this morning. However, there is an odd, sickly sweet smell in the air. It's cloying and unpleasant enough that you wouldn't be able to sleep here.
You can easily see that something horrible happened in this room. Everything is torn up, and blood stains are everywhere. The air is thick with the stink of death.
$The wormgrass hasn't grown back yet.
A band of humans charges you. Several are armored, several are mages. The mages have an odd eye insignia on their robes. You don't get the chance to ask what it means, because they attack you.
You meet an Empire patrol, wandering the hills looking for someone or something. When they see you, they immediately decide you're who they're hunting for.
You search the bodies. You find gold, and a variety of useful items. However, you find no sign of who they are or where they came from.
You are taken into the inner sanctum, and taught the learning and rituals of the church in a clipped, cost efficient way. You are told to strive for self-improvement in all things, and that the obtaining of money is the surest path to that end.
The temple's prayer books are very good. You learn the spells Divine Thud and Mass Charm. In addition, your Mage Lore skill improves. Eventually, you leave, your heads filled with a variety of bizarre ideas.
You are welcomed back to the temple and accorded all the luxuries due someone who's entered the inner circle. You are given food and drink, and trade news about goings on. There's nothing much else for you to do here. You leave.#The mandrake hasn't grown back yet.~A priest approaches you. However, when he sees your Anama rings, he turns mutely back. The gates are closed tight against you.
A large patrol of Empire soldiers marches near you. They are very apathetic - they barely bother to search as they march. They give you a cursory look, and march on. It is strange to see Empire troops so demoralized.
This remote, rubble strewn valley has a path leading up into it. You would guess that the path has been used a fair amount, and not just by people but by carts and wagons. You wonder why so many people would march up such a nondescript valley.lWhen it becomes clear that you won't leave peacefully, the guards don't shrink from the task of slaying you.
You march into the large valley, currently occupied by the stranded Third Empire Army. The army is determined to keep interlopers at a safe distance, and your being from Exile doesn't help. A band of guards moves to keep you away.
As you turn, the shade says _Wait please!_ Then, a moment later, it wavers. _Oh no! I must fly, before I am found!_ It disappears.
It says _I hoped you would come to me. It is easy to appear here, near where my body is. The key is in Footracer, and the key to Footracer is in Blackcrag._
_Blackcrag has a side entrance - search closely. You will have allies against us, so that we may be stopped._ The form wavers. _Oh no! I must fly, before I am found!_ It disappears.&The comfrey root isn't quite ripe yet.
You are in a massive expanse of plains. The roots of the thick, lush grasses are too thick for Empire plows to cut, so these lands have escaped domestication so far. With the monster plagues, they are mostly empty now, or settlers or travelers.
To the north, you see an enormous mountain range, the largest in the Empire, which separates Valorim from the rest of the world. Due north, you can see a huge pass, and can just make out the fort blocking it.
Ahead of you to the north, you see a massive fortress. It's a huge slab of black stone, it's sharp parapets watched by a multitude of Empire soldiers. This is Blackcrag Fortress, the sentinel watching the pass between Valorim and the rest of the Empire.
Unfortunately, Valorim is under quarantine. This castle is here not the keep the people of Valorim safe, but to keep them in. The guards watch as you approach, ready to kill you if you overstep your bounds.{You search for some good ember flowers but the specimens you find are completely inadequate for your purposes. Maybe later.
As you search the flowers for good specimens, you hear dark, ethereal laughter. You look around, and find that a group of swamp denizens has soundlessly surrounded you. You have no choice but to fight.
The forest ahead is very dark and shadowy. Eerie flickering light dance among the trees. The branches over your head sway slightly, which is very peculiar considering there's no wind.VThe forest gets darker, and seems to close in around you. You suddenly lose the path. aThe forest brightens a little, and you think you see sunlight ahead. You think you're almost out.
The ground of this remote valley is covered with a thin layer of slime. Suddenly, the stones under your feet start to buckle and shift! Huge, loathsome creatures slither out of the earth, pleased that food has come to them at last.
The monsters dead, you eagerly search for loot. Unfortunately, way up here in the mountains, they haven't really been able to get any. The little metal you find has been nearly disintegrated by the worm's acidic excretions. Very disappointing.mYou give the gremlins your food. The scurry off with it, cackling hideously. You're alone in the woods again.
You refuse the gremlin's request, hoping they won't attack you. Your hopes are in vain. Angered by your insolence, they charge you.
You give the gremlins your food. Unfortunately, you don't have enough to sate them. After gobbling down what you do have, they decide to have you for dessert.
You search the bodies of the unpleasant forest creatures. They don't have much. However, one of the gorgons was wearing a gold necklace! You take it with.)The glowing nettle hasn't grown back yet.
You stand at the end of a deep, dark valley, full of sharp crags and broad expanses of rubble. In the distance, you see a massive stone circle, each of the stones eighty feet high. You feel a strange overwhelming compulsion to approach it.
You stand at the end of a deep, dark valley, full of sharp crags and broad expanses of rubble. In the distance, you see a massive stone circle, each of the stones eighty feet high. The clouds overhead are gray and angry, and the valley is full of shadows.
You climb this craggy valley, watching carefully for alien beasts. At the head of the valley, you see a huge cave mouth. As you climb, you suddenly feel a strange, powerful desire to go north and explore. You struggle to fight it.
You climb this craggy valley, watching carefully for alien beasts. At the head of the valley, you see a huge cave mouth. As you climb, you suddenly feel a strange, faint desire to go north and explore. You aren't sure why.
You hear a strange whispering inside your head. You recognize it - you heard it in the stone circles you found around Valorim. It tells you you must go north. You can go this way no farther. The compulsion to go north overwhelms you. 
As you climb into this dark valley, you suddenly start feeling a powerful desire to go to the end of it. Strange voices in your heads pull you forward. You feel you can't reach the end soon enough.
As you climb into this dark valley, you suddenly start feeling a powerful desire to go to the end of it. Somehow, you think a major reward awaits you at the end.xWhen you move forward, the massive pack howls and charges. Their six powerful legs churn up a remarkable amount of dust.3The beasts attack without the slightest hesitation.
You search the guards. The alien beasts have broken their weapons and chewed up their armor. You do find some gold, and a nice bronze ring. As you leave, however, you see that the alien beasts have found you.
The clouds over this valley are so thick that it almost seems like night, even though it's the middle of the afternoon. A bitter wind sears your exposed skin. There are bits of bone everywhere. You suspect you're getting close to the end.
A patrol of Vahnatai guards runs up to you. They pause. At first you think that your former allies may be ready to parley with you. They, emitting eardrum tearing screams, they charge.
You stare out at an all too familiar sight - a cavern, miles wide, lit by green fluorescent fungi. Your eyes quickly adjust, absorbing the grim familiarity of the view. You have no warm feeling of homecoming - these are Vahnatai lands, not human.
It was from this cave that the Vahnatai sought to obtain their total vengeance on the Empire that wronged them. It is from here that the monsters originated, and it is here they must be stopped. Somehow.
A Vahnatai patrol had seen you approach, and was waiting in ambush. When you get close, they emerge and charge. Their battle cries echo across the cavern.
The water is cool and refreshing. Incredibly so, in fact. It must have absorbed energy from the stone it passed through. You feel recharged.
As you drink, the water rapidly loses its glow. It's unlikely anyone will be able to get any appreciable benefit from this pool until it recharges, which won't be for some time.
This small, modest bridge crosses this river at a narrow spot. The path and the bridge have already gathered a light layer of mold. The Vahnatai must not come up here much.
More Vahnatai have died at your hand. You feel ill. Considering that it was their aid that saved you in the war with the Empire, it's horrible that it has had to come to this.
Although there are lots of ember flowers here, only the most perfect flowers are usable for alchemy. None of them are quite sufficient right now.
You draw your weapons and attack. As you approach, his features shift and change, and other creatures start appearing in the clearing with you. Unsurprisingly, not all was as it appeared.fHe laughs mockingly at you. _Fine, children. If you ever get any spine, I'll be waiting here for you._
vYou kill the demon. His body moulders and disappears. Pleasantly, you find that the bar of gold was real, and take it.
You find an isolated cluster of farms, far from any large settlement. The farmers come out to greet you, suspicious and reasonably armed. When they see you mean no harm, however, they become very friendly. Visitors are rare out here, after all.
You find out that they moved out into the wilderness to get away from the control of the Empire, a motive you can easily understand. You tell them the sobering news from the rest of Valorim, and after an excellent home cooked meal, you depart.
The valley suddenly gets a lot colder. Your noses and ears begin to sting, and your feet find uncertain purchase on the frosty rocks. Suddenly, you realize the things off the path that you thought were snowbanks are, in fact, moving.
As you ascend into this valley, a rude wind chills you through your armor. You don't have much farther to go before you'll be around snow. Frost is everywhere, and plants and animals are scarce.
The farmers recognize and greet you, taking you home for tea, pie, news trading, and conversation. As you chat, they mention idly that there are no human settlements to the north, just a massive wall blocking off Valorim from the rest of the Empire.
A gust of stinging, icy wind hits you in the face. You turn away and shut your eyes for a moment, and when you turn back you realize you are no longer alone.  The wind has carried in several large, white drakes with it.
You meet a swift moving platoon of Empire troops, operating out of Tevrono and hunting for golems. The Dervish leading them nods briefly to you, before they move on.
You find a grove, blasted by flame, trampled by heavy golem feet. Oddly, no golems are to be seen. However, in the middle of the open area, you see a stone circle, in the middle of which you see an odd spectral light.
When you charge the golem line, a band of soldiers from Tevrono, seeing an opening, charge up to help you out. There's a lot of golems. The help may well be needed.
You find the bodies of a mother bear and her cubs, burned to death by a golem fireball. This must be a small victory in the golem's war to strip this whole province of life.
You find a small path leading into and out of Tevrono. No golems are here. Instead, there's a band of soldiers and Dervishes, standing guard.FNone of the holly sprigs are of sufficient quality to use for alchemy.xThe Empire soldiers bring their wounded back into Tevrono, pausing to thank you for your help in breaking this blockade.
You find a large glade. It has been stripped of vegetation - the grass and shrubs have been burned away by the golems. In the center, you can see a huge stone circle. It glows with a strange feral light.
You see a huge clearing, scarred by fireballs, scarred by many golem feet. This must be a center of major golem activity. You look closely and focus your eyes. Concentrating, you manage to just make out an enormous tower, dominating the glade.
You see a huge clearing, scarred by fireballs, scarred by many golem feet. This must be a center of major golem activity. Frustratingly, you cannot see any structures or signs of anything important. If anything is here, you'll have to find out elsewhere.
Your woodsman skills come in handy. You move quietly off the path, slipping from tree to tree, moving forward when the golems are looking away. Soon, you're safely past!
You try to slip past off the pathway. Unfortunately, you lack the skills to move quickly and quietly through the brush. Your clumsy thrashing soon brings the golems down on your heads.
You find the signs of a skirmish between the Empire and the golems. A dozen of the bladed golems lie about, chopped into pieces. The Empire forces must have done pretty well.
You find the body of a deer, frozen and then shattered by an Ice Golem. It was a horrible, senseless act of violence. The golems must be killing everything, no matter how threatening or harmless.
You enter, expecting bears, goblins, or something like that. Instead, you find a group of six legged, muscular, foul looking creatures. There are signs that they've been hiding here for some time. They're very glad for the chance to start fighting again.
The stone spire just to the west looks just like an eagle. This natural formation would be much more impressive, if you weren't so surrounded by horror and death.;The holly hasn't recovered from your last trip through yet.
Something that could pierce this wall is something you don't want to deal with. You move away quickly. You look back once, and see several gray shapes moving off into the brush. With a flash of light, the wall reseals itself.
You draw your weapons and wait. Soon,  with a final push, the creatures break through the magical defenses. They're six legged beasts, five feet tall at the shoulder. With joyous howls, they attack you immediately.
You move through the gate. On the other side, you find a large crowd of muscular beasts, each with six legs, each about five feet tall at the shoulder. They've been waiting here in the hope of someone coming through, and it's finally paid off ...
You emerge from the caldera, to find yourself in a huge valley. It's high in the mountains, barren, and icy cold. You look over the fields of snowbanks, searching the desolation for signs of life. The land is criss crossed with the trails of alien beasts.
As you step out, the creatures that were hiding behind the snowdrifts charge out. As assortment of the Vahnatai's monsters rush at you, hoping to stop your advance right here.
You see a group of Vahnatai guards in the distance. They see you. You try to move away, only to find how amazingly fast the creatures are able to move through caves. You have to fight them.
You look out over a large subterranean bay, with two massive, recently built docks. You see a dozen stone boats swiftly flowing away from them downstream. This must be how the Vahnatai get from the deep warrens to here and back.
You find a narrow, rough path through this tunnel. There are also the scratches left by sledges being dragged through here. This corridor has had a lot of traffic up and down it.
You are on a huge, natural stone bridge, over a mile long, arcing over a massive chasm. To the east, through the thick, green tinted mist, you can make out a massive, squat black tower.
You can see more of the tower. It's enormous, and ghastly green light pours out of the windows. You can feel the power radiating from it even out here. You have the feeling that your quest may finally be coming to an end.
Unfortunately, there are no boats left at the docks. Also, the departing Vahnatai have left behind a considerable force. Seeing you, they instantly rush to attack.
You grimly butcher the rest of the guards, confident of nothing but that this battle was a mere appetizer for the banquet of carnage to come.
A small, pathetic Empire patrol, equipped with shoddy uniforms and shoddy weapons, approaches you. They tell you they're looking for a band of Empire army deserters who've been robbing caravans in this area. They look very relieved that you aren't them.
You leave the campsite, still confused by the lack of guards. You soon find out where the guards were, unfortunately ... they were out looking for the bulk of the bandit force. You soon see them, getting back to their cache as fast as they can.
You decline his offer. He smiles. _Oh, well. Always a market for my wares in troubled times._ He gives you some more tea and then bids you farewell.
The renegade soldiers are all dead. You've just made life a lot easier for the people living in these parts. Unfortunately, all the loot they owned was already back at their camp.
The glowing shape suddenly glows, turns red, and splits into several shapes. They coalesce into solid, fiery humanoid beings, each nine feet tall. One of them barks _At last! Our masters have had enough of you. Prepare to die!_ They attack.
The sight of this desolate, blasted valley sends chills up your spines. It's dark and lifeless, filled with bones, and reeks of sulphur. There are also many lizard scales, some of them as much as a foot wide. You feel like you're being watched.
The bones are mostly, but not all, of animals. There's also humanoid bones, and the remains of some large beasts with 6 legs you're not sure you recognize.
You charge the encampment. They see you, and react instantly. Several of them pull out rough clubs and try to delay you. The rest of them flee into the hills. You butcher the fighters easily, but they achieve their mission. Their women and young get away.
You search their encampment. You find a tiny amount of food, little in the way of weapons, and no possessions. Whatever or whoever this clan was, they were poor and almost totally defenseless. Having nothing else to do, you leave.IYou back away from the Nephilim encampment, unsure what to do about them.
The shade doesn't coalesce all the way, remaining a vague, glowing, insubstantial humanoid shape. It says _Exile's struggle continues. You have been seen. They search for me, too. I can help you little now._
_The enemy is near, and their hatred is great. More monsters are being prepared. The attack on Valorim is only the beginning. The vengeance will continue. They must be stopped. Please, for us all, fight on. I must go. It is unsafe._ The shade disappears.
A shadow flits across the ground towards you. You look up to see what casts it, and gasp. It's a massive lizard, eighty feet from head to tip at least. It circles over you, looking down at you, and then flies east over the mountains. It's gone. 
A platoon of Empire soldiers, nervous and alert, comes near you. They don't approach or say anything. They only look you over and move off quickly. Their weapons were drawn and bows were nocked. Whatever they're looking for, they're very nervous about it.
You come across the ruins of a small farming community. A half dozen farms were clumped together here. Something destroyed them, however, the overgrowth indicates it happened at least six months ago.
The terrifying thing is the huge force that was exerted on the sturdy stone buildings. They were smashed apart, as if someone had attacked each one with a battering ram. However, the stone shows claw marks - the buildings were torn apart by huge animals.
The efreeti and their salamander pets lie dead before you. Alas, you find nothing to help you figure out where they came from or who sent them.QYou walk away quickly. When you look back, you see that the shade has faded away.GShe slowly unzips her skin tight leather jumpsuit. _Oh boy_, you think.
You encounter a band of Empire army deserters, hiking west to escape the carnage to the east. They seem to feel you're an easy target for a quick robbery.
The bit of land encircled by the river to the east was an Empire army outpost. The wall to the west and the river to the east made it a perfect place to keep soldiers safe and fed when the army wasn't out marching.
The outpost has been destroyed. Some creatures actually clawed their way through the thick stone walls, and the settlement was devastated. This happened some time ago ... you only find broken weapons and crumbled buildings, all starting to be overgrown.
You find the site of a small battle between humans and golems. Unusually, the humans seem to have won, and won decisively. You find the broken down remnants of thirty golems, and no dead humans.
eCarved on the torsos of one of the destroyed stone creatures is a simple message: _Baziron Was Here._gA small band golems, faceless, powerful, tireless, and implacable, reaches you. They attack fearlessly.
You meet a patrol of Empire soldiers. Unusually, they seem cleaned up, well equipped, and entirely professional. They tell you they're operating out of Tevrono under General Baziron, and to watch out for golems. Then they leave.
This valley is deathly silent and devoid of life, and the dirt and stones are covered with a thin layer of slime. These signs, together, are generally indicative of a highly unwelcoming place.oYou leave the gold and turn back. As you walk away, you hear the eye beast's eerie keening laughter behind you.kWhen the eye beasts see that no payment is coming, they react with instant and mind shattering violence ...YYou walk straight into a golem ambush. They move rapidly and mechanically from the woods.
You return to the concealed settlement of soldiers. Grateful for your delivering of their message, they welcome you in for coffee and military-type camaraderie. They also heal your wounds before you depart.
They are clearly angered and offended by your refusal to help them. Your visit doesn't last long after that. They roughly blindfold you and march you off into the woods. When you can remove the blindfolds, you find you're alone.
A patrol of Empire soldiers, marching close together with weapons at the ready, comes near you. When they see you aren't golems, however, you cease to be interesting to them. They march off without a word.
The forest suddenly grows very silent. Slowly, a group of faceless gleaming statues comes into view, approaching you. They look you over carefully, seemingly analyzing you and estimating your strength. Then their programming tells them to attack you.JWhen you move towards their line, the golems do not hesitate in attacking.
You join the soldiers for what looks like a cakewalk of a battle. However, when golems start crawling over the railings of the bridge, it becomes clear that the creatures have set an ambush. The intense battle begins. 
The soldiers thank you profusely for saving their bacon. They tell you they're led by General Baziron, in Tevrono, the only general to have success leading soldiers against the golems. They tell you to be sure to go up and meet him. Then they head north.yThe Empire army had a small fort here. It didn't last long in the face of golem fireball barrages. There isn't much left.
You find the chopped up remains of a dozen Fire Golems. The lack of charring in the surrounding vegetation indicates that they were destroyed before they were even able to shoot flames back. One of them has 'Baziron' carved into the once featureless face.
They give you a small sealed scroll. Their captain says _We know you're Exiles, but all we've heard tells us you can be trusted. Don't let us down. General Baziron needs to get this!_ They blindfold you again, and take you back to where they found you.
You encounter the soldier's concealed camp. However, their memories of your refusing to help them are still fresh. The brush you off and disappear into the woods.
You meet a patrol of Empire soldiers. They're clearly on edge, and clearly searching very carefully for something. They ask you if you've seen signs of 'the beasts' nearby. When they hear you haven't, they move on, relieved.
There was a massive battle here, you would guess about a year ago. Bits of broken metal and bone are everywhere, and the ground is still lightly stained with blood. The scars of fireballs are everywhere.
You find several skeletons. They were large, six legged creatures. The number of these you find is very small, compared to the size of the battlefield. It can't have gone very well for the humans.
Twenty heavily armored guards are watching the bridge. They ask you if you've seen signs of 'the beasts' nearby. When they hear you haven't, they motion for you to move on, relieved.
From a hill here, you are able to get a good view of the massive wall surrounding Footracer Province. It glows slightly, a sign of the powerful spells placed on it to keep the alien beasts imprisoned inside.
Nearby, you find several human skeletons, and some scraps of the mage's robes they were wearing when they died. The alien beasts caught them and literally ripped them limb from limb. The enchanting of the wall was clearly not done without great cost.
This large bridge is poorly maintained, and is starting to be overgrown with ivy and moss. Although this is clearly a major route, people must be going out of their way to stay away from here.
This group of hungry ogres is very pleased that you've stumbled right into its camp. Their leader has odd purplish skin, and an ornate staff. They quickly move in on you ...
The ground shudders under you. A massive, pale creature starts working its way out of the ground near you. You were so distracted by its appearance that you didn't notice the ogres moving to encircle you. You can't help but feel that was their plan ...MA narrow footpath leads up into the mountains. It has the look of recent use.
It starts raining rocks. They aren't coming from the sky, however, but from a band of giants about 500 feet away. You charge them before they can pelt you anymore.
You come across a band of giants, probably going to throw more boulders at Lorelei. They decide, for a change of pace, to throw them at you instead.
This was a huge, beautiful bridge, covered with intricate carvings and lovely marblework. It was a beautiful piece of Empire engineering. Unfortunately, giants have been using it for target practice. It's still standing, but that's all you can say for it.
The captain bows. _All right sirs, I understand._ He doesn't seem suspicious of you. The other soldiers, on the other hand, look extremely skeptical. Fortunately, you get a safe distance away before anyone decides to attack.
You whip out your blades, and try to take them by surprise! Unfortunately, several of these men and women were very suspicious of you, and were more than prepared for an attack. This is going to be ugly.
One of the Empire wizards walks up, mumbles a brief spell, and touches each of your packs. Finally, he walks back to the captain. _They're clean._ The captain apologizes again for the trouble, and waves you by.
One of the Empire wizards walks up, mumbles a brief spell, and touches each of your packs. He then backs rapidly away from you, yelling _They have some!_ Things go rapidly downhill from there.
You notice that the river gets broad and shallow here, and has a small island in the middle. It would be possible to, with difficulty, ford it here.
You find several farmhouses and a scattering of barns. All of them have been caved in under a hail of boulders thrown by giants. All the residents have fled or been killed. Everything of value has been looted by the hill giants.
Your motions are almost automatic, taking place in a strange, dreamlike state. You kneel again at the altar, yell some words in a language you don't understand, stand, and walk out. When your mind clears, you feel much more experienced.
You approach the altar again. You suddenly lose control of your bodies. You kneel and start chanting. You don't understand the words you're saying - they just flow out of your mouths, for how long you cannot say.
Then you stand, and leave. Knowledge fills your minds. You learn the spells Mass Paralysis and Death Arrows. However, you have a feeling you can't explain. You feel like some events have been set in motion, and you no longer have any control over them.
Shadows pass overhead. You look up, only to see several strange clouds. Each has several eyes floating in it, each of which looks down at you. They emit a strange keening sound. Then they descend to attack.
This island is very creepy. It's covered with lots of dead things. Dead humanoid things. Far, far more than one would expect. Then the dead things shakily get up and stagger towards you, in order to invite you to join them.)The shade fades away. The glade is empty.
The shade says _The fight continues. Golems and giants. But the key is in Tinraya. The alien beasts guard the way to the core. Look first to Blackcrag. Hope is not lost, but the worst comes. I must go._ It then disappears.
You meet a well equipped and sharp looking patrol of Empire soldiers. It looks like they've been camped by the road for some time. When they see you, they do something different from what most of the other Empire troops you've met have done - they attack!LLooks like the word is out about you. A band of Empire soldiers charges you.
You hear the sounds of many flapping wings. You look up, and see dozens of huge bats circling over you. They then fly quickly off.
You walk towards the galleon, thoughts of great treasure circling in your minds. Then you notice the ground you're walking on, that looked so solid a few minutes ago, is fetid, foul, and marshy. You start to feel ill. 
As the illness spreads, you look up at the galleon and see it slowly fade away. The illusion covering the marsh disappears as well. You turn back, and see the creatures who made the illusions, looking at you hungrily.
You hear deep, throaty chuckles, coming from the woods around you. The air has suddenly grown very cold. Monsters are moving through the undergrowth towards you.
The still forest air, normally not too warm or welcoming, grows much colder. You hear, from not far away, the tortured keening of damned souls.
You stand in the middle of a grove of trees, unusual for their square shape. These may be the trees the flower dryad told you about.
You survey the carnage, satisfied that you have rid the enemy that has been causing so much havoc in Calloc. Unfortunately, you find no loot to take back.
You search the ruin, and find bodies. The place is a charnel house, filled with dead settlers and guards, all stripped of loot. As you look around, you stumble upon a few of the creatures responsible, floating around looking for more things to kill.OYou look around, but don't find any graymold suitable for alchemy. Maybe later.
You meet a group of faceless, lethal looking statues, moving quickly and smoothly through the brush. They attack everything living they see, be it plants, animals, or you.
You meet a pathetic Empire patrol. Some of the soldiers are mildly wounded. Others have only crude weapons. All are exhausted. They march by slowly, giving you only the barest of glances.
You meet a quick moving, fairly fresh Empire patrol. When they get close to you, they look you over. They seem to recognize you, and have a quick discussion. The result is unfortunate - they attack immediately.
This marsh is infested with giant snakes, a bunch of which have emerged in order to hunt down some large, fresh meat. Some of the snakes are larger and weirder looking than the others.
When you get close, the guards show just how jumpy they really are. They rush out of the encampment to attack you. It looks like the fumes from the plants the camp has been processing have made them slightly deranged.
You don't get far into the mine, before you find that it's been sealed off. Explosions have sealed off the passage with hundreds of tons of rock.
You search the mine, and find it pleasantly devoid of nasty monsters. It's also been mostly cleaned out, although you do find a cart of gold ore that got left behind when the miners fled. You help yourself.
You move down into the mine, only to find the main entrance was sealed off only a hundred feet in. You move back out, only to find you've walked into a golem ambush. The animated, lethal statues are waiting for you at the entrance.
The guards are about to attack you, when one of them recognizes you. They welcome you in, telling you that this is a site for processing Skribbane herb smuggled from the Isle of Bigail, and that they knew that you've helped smuggle it.
You move away, leaving the caravan quickly behind. The Empire army deserters make short work of the caravan guards, and send the merchants fleeing into the hills. It's a pathetic sight, and, fortunately, not your problem.
Everyone involved in this growing battle is surprised by your approach. The soldiers are surprised that anyone would defy them, and the merchants are surprised to find out that they might not be about to die.
The merchants bandage up their wounded, thank you profusely, and move quickly south. They don't offer a reward, unfortunately, but from the looks of things, they didn't have a gold piece to spare.
This open area was once a lush expanse of farmland, dotted with farms and guardposts. Piles of freshly cut lumber, from the logging camps to the north, would be stacked everywhere, waiting to be shipped out.
Now, the attacks of the golems and raids from renegade soldiers have devastated the area. Only small, isolated patches of farmland remain, most of the farms have been abandoned or burned out, and only the city of Gale seems anywhere near intact.
This is a long, massive stone wall, constructed to keep the lands to the south safe from golem attack. Unfortunately, the wall is nowhere near wide enough yet. The golems can simply walk around it. It's basically worthless.
You encounter an Empire patrol. It's a particularly lackluster and unenthusiastic band of troops - most look conscripted from the ranks of local farmers. Unwilling to be in a fight of any sort, they say hello and walk away.
You aren't sure when the settlements on this island were destroyed, but it was definitely some years ago. This island is a wasteland, part ruined towns and colonies, part rock and rubble.
There are no animals or birds anywhere that you can see. There aren't even seagulls. You do see a lot of bones, and not all of them are from animals. It's a very dark place.
Everyone seems somewhat unhinged from the fumes of the boiling herb, and you're starting to feel a bit odd yourself. You manage to get away quickly, before anyone totally loses it.
You encounter a band of shambling zombies, roving the island in an undead sort of way. They attack you. Somehow, you aren't quite intimidated.
You can't help but recognize the creature you see: it's smelly, hairy, wears furs, and is over twelve feet tall. It's a giant. It's hard to believe though ... the Empire wiped all the giants off the surface a century ago! What's one doing here?
This group of bandits seems to think your group is an easy target. Your fine armor and weapons makes you too rich a score for them to pass up. They pull their weapons, ready spells, and rush you.
An Empire patrol approaches you, and gruffly informs you that they're looking for monsters and bandits. Although your pale skin makes you very suspicious to them, you soon convince them you aren't what they're looking for, and they move on.yThe small patch of wormgrass growing at the base of the boulder has not yet recovered from your last visit. Give it time.
You pull out your blades and approach the roaches, expecting them to be slow and bloated on meat. Unfortunately, not only are they quite alert, but they're very fast on feet for their huge size. Hissing loudly, they attack.
You cautiously back away. Soon, the massive creatures have their fill of the rotting bear, and tromp back into the woods. For their size and weight, they move surprisingly quietly.oYou bid farewell to Vanvor. He yells after you, quite unnecessarily, _And watch out for the giant cockroaches!_
This stone bridge is quite a feat of Empire engineering. It arcs a full hundred feet over the river. At the north end, there is no road, only barely settled wilderness. To the south is Softport, and roads leading off to civilization.
A rock smashes into the road in front of you. It's eight inches across, but one of the creatures emerging from the woods threw it without effort. That shot missed, but they're clearly prepared to try again ...
A band of roaches catches up with you and attacks. Looking back where they came from, you see a trail of devastation: torn up plants, gnawed off tree bark, dead small animals. These things seem to be programmed to destroy everything, no matter what.
You have crossed some stepping stones, and ended up on a small island. There are lots of nice small trees and pretty flowers, and a lovely spring. There are deer, and bluebirds. You have a little picnic. 'You find a big patch of pretty flowers.
You search the flower patch, but don't find any glowing nettle which is quite ready for harvesting. If you return later, you'll probably find some.
You move into the hollow, hoping to join in the celebration. Unfortunately, the partiers are not humans. They're gremlins. As much as they're enjoying their liquor, they would clearly enjoy tormenting you more. They charge.
When you approach, the roach says, in a squeaky, high-pitched voice, _Wow! You're a big meanie!_ You stop, surprised, and the roach takes this opportunity to run off into the undergrowth.
As you turn away, the roach speaks to you! It's voice is high-pitched, perky, and friendly. It says _You guys are nice! Bye!_ and scuttles off into the underbrush. It takes a moment to convince yourself it actually happened. Things are getting weirder.
You search the gremlin's hollow, but the food they stole has somehow disappeared. You only find their booze, and you've heard enough about the effects of faerie liquor to decide that leaving it behind is the wiser course.
You see an all too common sight: a cluster of farmhouses, surrounded by a hastily erected rock barrier. A ragtag band of farmers guards the wall. You approach, but they clearly want nothing to do with strangers.
Construction of the road stopped here, just in front of a heavy forest. It'll be a huge effort to hack a path out through that thicket. Axes, stones, and other building materials are strewn about. However, it looks like they haven't been used for a while.vYou dispatch the last of the filthy little vermin, and take care to give your weapon blades a good, thorough cleaning.
You defeat another band of the creatures, and give your weapons yet another, even more thorough cleaning. Some of those roaches had been of the exceptionally filthy variety.
This hilly area looks completely ordinary and uninteresting. However, you are sure that you can hear the distant hissing of giant roaches. Lots and lots of giant roaches. You look around, but can't find where the hissing is coming from. Odd.
This hilly area looks completely ordinary and uninteresting. However, you are sure that you can hear the distant hissing of giant roaches. Lots and lots of giant roaches. You look around, and soon find the roach lair the friendly roaches told you about.
The forest, not welcoming even at its best, suddenly becomes noticeably colder and darker. You hear gurgling, hissing laughter. A breeze carries a sickly, carrion smell to you. Something is approaching you, and it doesn't want to be your friend.
One of the troglodyte lightning teams, moving fast behind enemy lines in order to create as much havoc as possible, moves in on you. They're small, horrible, stunted creatures, and drool in excitement as they approach.
A patrol of Empire guards moves up, watching you warily. When they get close and see how pale you are and how odd your group looks, their attitudes change for the worse. Just to play things safe, they attack you.
A patrol of Empire guards moves up, watching you warily. When they get close and get a good look at you, they start muttering amongst themselves. The captain shouts _We've heard all that you did. Move on, and watch yourself!_ They leave.
You are in a pass through these mountains. To the northeast, you see barren, unsettled territory. To the southwest is the water, and civilization. You have the eerie feeling that you're being watched.
A band of guards emerges from one of the villas and relieves you of your food. One of the merchants gives you a sack of copper and silver coins. After a quick count to verify you haven't been cheated, you move on.
You try to make a deal, but when they see how much food you have, they shake their heads. _Sorry. You haven't much in the way of goods. Try bringing more, and maybe we can strike a deal._ You try to negotiate, but when you see they're adamant, you depart.
You return to the well guarded merchant's villa. They greet you warmly, but say _Thanks to the food you brought us, we'll be well supplied for some time. We won't need any more for months. Thanks!_ You leave.
There was a town here, and quite recently too. Someone, using tools and spells, has razed it to the ground. The rubble has been spread across the countryside. It was a very thorough job.
You look for more graymold to scrape off the rocks, but the patches you find are too small to use. You'll have to come back later.
A priest emerges from the compound, casts a brief spell, looks at you closely, and walks back inside. Guards close the gates. Nobody comes out to speak with you. Nobody even looks at you. Eventually, you get bored and leave.yYou decline the Anama Institute's offer, and bid them farewell. They wish you luck, and close the heavy gates behind you.
The giants repulsed, the column of refugees is able to get safely away. One of the captains comes over to thank you profusely before heading back to help escort the farmers. As they leave, you hear some of them say _They were the Exiles! They saved us!_-You move away quietly. It's not your problem.
You arrive on the scene of a very peculiar combat. Several dryads are fighting a bunch of hill giants. However, the forest creatures are not fighting with blades, but with trickery. They are harassing the giants with spells.
You see hill giants chase shades out into swamps, trip over animated tree roots, and suddenly, mysteriously lie down for naps. All this is annoying them, but not actually damaging them. When they see a band of solid, real humans to attack, they cheer.
A dozen dryads float out of the woods, surrounded by bouncing, leering gremlins. The oldest and tallest one says _Thank you! Here is a little gift to show our appreciation._ She hands you a large flask. The faerie creatures then fade into the woods.
You reenter the dryad glade. As you do, the trees suddenly start to rearrange themselves! The forest grows fuzzy around you. When your head clears, you aren't where you were.
When you get close to the village, you notice that several of the humans have snuck around behind you. You look closer, and see that the walls of the village are decorated with human bones! These people seem disinclined to let you go ...
You search the village. You find a variety of trinkets and coins, as well as a lot of food you're very skeptical about eating. You find a bizarre shrine filled with bones and symbols you've never seen before. Very creepy. You leave.
Although the patch of flowers is very large, only the largest, most perfect specimens are useful for alchemy. None of these flowers are quite right. Fortunately, some should be ripe in a day or two.
This old bridge hasn't been maintained, or, as far as you can tell, even traveled over for some time. It's covered with moss and vines, and the stones are starting to fall out. It's safe to cross though, for now.
You sack their camp. You find plenty of coins and bits of metal you can spend later, a bunch of broken and rusty weapons, some armor that's far too small for you, and a fairly nice, new suit of human-sized chain mail.
This unfortunate farm became a rock throwing practice range for the hill giants. It's hard to tell that there were buildings here - the structures are buried in thick piles of round, head-sized stones. When giants destroy something, they're thorough.
The hill giant guards, bored by long, tedious stints of guard duty, are more than happy to break the monotony by fighting some humans.
This rocky area is where the hill giants collect most of their throwing stones. Giant tracks and piles of prospective rocks are everywhere. They're evidently very picky about the stones they actually take into battle.
The dryad smiles and walks calmly back inside her tree. You're alone again. Confused, you turn back, only to find the forest looks very different than it did a minute ago._You come across an all too familiar sight in Valorim - a wrecked farm, destroyed by the giants.
On the wall of one of the cairns, you find a series of inscriptions, explaining the rituals necessary to bind the undead here and keep them from roaming, You now know the spell Force Barrier.
You find something bizarre. It's a stone spire, of brown, uninteresting rock. Skeletons, each with a pair of red, gleaming stones for eyes, are circled around it, silently touching it and bowing to it.uWhen you get close, however, the skeletons turn away from the spire and approach you. Their eye stones glow fiercely.
A band of highly armed and alert priests approach and greet you. They tell you they're an Anama patrol, looking for either cockroaches or diseased people. When they see that you're just adventurers, not roaches or poor townspeople, they move on.
You meet a patrol of Empire soldiers, patrolling out of Shayder. They warn you to be sure to clean up your trash, and to stay away from the city if you start showing signs of disease. You say you will, and they move on.|A group of the disgusting insectoid creatures catches up with you. They hiss hungrily as they approach, ready to devour you.
The farmhouses have been abandoned. A note on one of the doors says _Roaches too much. Disease too much. Moved to Shayder._ Nothing of value has been left behind, but several of the smaller roaches skitter around, looking for food.
As you approach, several of the farmers come out to greet you. They all wear the rings that mark them as members of the Anama church. When they see you lack the rings, they are cordial, but cold. Seeing nothing is to be gained here, you move on.
As you approach, several of the farmers come out to greet you. They all wear the rings that mark them as members of the Anama church. When they see you wear the rings too, they welcome you in for tea and a hearty meal, and give you some food for the road.
You work your way through the thick forest, the canopy of branches overhead blocking out most of the sun's light. This island would be rather beautiful, if it weren't for the horrors that you know infest it.
You suddenly hear a soft hissing noise, coming from all around you. The underbrush shakes, and the sounds come closer. Soon, you are being chased by a large group of hideous, doberman-sized cockroaches.
You pull a broadsword out of the muck and clean it off. It's still usable after being in that goo - a sure sign of its quality. You feel quite pleased with yourselves. As you walk away, however, you soon start to feel quite ill ...
A group of giant, hissing roaches, unsatisfied with scavenging and munching on the local plant life, decides to hunt up some fresher meat. This means you.
The spiders manage to defeat the roaches despite your cowardice, but with heavy losses. They bind up and drag off their victims, only occasionally pausing to give you a reproachful gaze. You hear one of them say _They're bad._
The roaches defeated, the spiders happily help away their wounded, paralyze the roaches, and bind them in web. As they sing little, happy bug eating songs, several of them come up to thank you and try to kiss you. Victory is yours.
You hear the all too familiar hissing, and smell rotting flesh. Huge roaches scuttle out of the undergrowth to attack you. Several of them are unusual: they have large wings, and are covered with slime, as if they'd been recently writhing around in filth.
As you move into this dark and shadowy copse of trees, you notice that many of the branches have spider webs on them. Very large spider webs. Grapefruit sized spiders watch you hungrily as you pass.
You find the dried out husks of several giant cockroaches. The eight foot long roaches are wrapped in thick webs, and have been sucked dry. You wouldn't want to fight the spiders able to bring these monsters down.]This bit of forest is unusually dark, and thick spiderwebs hang everywhere. It's very creepy.
As you pluck out the wand, it sends vibrations running along the webs. These vibrations carry one message to the giant spiders hidden nearby: _Dinner._
Uttering high pitched battle cries, the spiders rush forward. Suddenly, the rocks erupt with massive numbers of cockroaches, none of them smaller than three feet long. Your spider allies bare poisonous fangs. A massive (and disgusting) battle is joined.
You work your way up a narrow, treacherous, rocky valley. At first, you think you've reach the end of it, but then you notice a gap in the rock up ahead. It was a tiny and well concealed passage ... you were lucky to notice it.
You reach the northeastern tip of the island, and find a bright, sunny, light copse of trees. Strange, though. When you enter, you notice that you can hear no animal noises at all - no birds, no animals. The overall effect is quite creepy.
Alas, you have stumbled directly into the path of a troglodyte platoon, going to make a serious raid on some human settlement. They decide you look wealthy enough to make a detour to slay you worthwhile.HA stealthy troglodyte raiding party rushes you, weapons drawn and ready.
Several farms are clustered here, enjoying the protection of a circular stone wall. Empire soldiers, ever alert, have been stationed here to protect Sharimik's food source. You approach, but, not recognizing you, they don't let you in.
There were several farms here, within a circular stone wall. A major troglo raid, however, has wiped the whole settlement out. All that's left are burned ruins, a few stray farm animals, and a lot of graves.
You must be getting close to the troglo fortress. This isn't a raiding party, but a platoon of guards. They decide that the best way to keep their home safe is to hunt you down and kill you.]It's a troglodyte ambush! The hunchbacked monsters emerge from concealed holes in the ground.
The troglodytes have a quick, spirited, monosyllabic discussion. They seem to be arguing about whether or not to attack you. They decide, unsurprisingly,  to take the more violent option.
You approach the troglodytes, holding your letter from Sharimik out in front of you. One of them looks it over, and the troglos argue for some time over whether to pay attention to it. Finally, they return the letter and let you pass.
A fairly new, paved stone footpath leads up the valley. It is lined with obelisks with strange writing on them. These are placed at regular, hundred foot intervals. There are lots of them.
This roaring river emerges from a natural tunnel. The water is fresh snowmelt, and is icy cold and incredibly refreshing. You look for a way to continue, and see a narrow path leading over the tunnel.pThe icy, fast flowing river emerges from the mountains above. A winding, rock path leads up along the riverbank.
You sneak out of the hills, hoping to catch the small village by surprise. Their ogre guards, however, see you as you approach. The whole giant clan turns out in order to help repulse you.
The giants and their ogre servants dead, you search the huts. There's a bit of gold and a bit of food, and a bunch of knick knacks that the giants seemed to value. Not much else to interest you.
The giants' huts only contained some gold, some food, and some junk. You take what's valuable and leave the rest. At first, it seems like lean pickings. Then, in the ogre magi's hut, you find a slender crystal wand!
You pick the mandrake. Unfortunately, this was a very small patch. It's not likely that any new mandrake will develop here for months.
Somehow, you're sure this area is the center of the evil affliction that this island suffers. There's something in the air, an icy edge, or the stench of decay, or something else you can't quite put a figure on.xThe large quantity of undead rising from gullies and pits to attack you, however, would seem to back up that hypothesis.
You find a small gully, filled with thousands of shedded skins from giant snakes. Clearly, this swamp is infested with giant, man-eating snakes. Unfortunately, a good number of them have started to hunt you.
You pocket the knife. Unusually, you receive no horrible magical retribution for your temple robbing. You leave the shrine, still having no idea who created it, to who, or why.
This band of lumpy humanoids, heavily armed and out for blood, moves close to you and sizes you up. They seem to think you're easy pickings - they charge, howling all the way.
A band of Empire soldiers moves close and looks you over. They clearly think you look very suspicious, but don't see you as their chosen prey. They move off without speaking to you.
A band of Empire troops approaches. They look you over and seem about to leave, when one of them says _Wait! Look at their skin! Those are the Exiles!_ They attack without hesitation.
A band of Empire troops approaches and looks you over. As they mutter to each other, you hear a few words: _Exiles_ and _killed slimes._ Casting a few suspicious glances back at you, they march off. /The troglodytes are more than ready for you ...
You approach, and several javelins thud into the ground in front of you. That was the warning shot. They look ready to heft a much more accurate volley. You decide to look for conversation somewhere else.
]Probably a wise choice. The troglodytes look relieved, and you certainly avoided a big fight.~Swords come out on both sides. The troglodytes are ready to fight to the death to defend their lucrative extortion enterprise.
One of the troglodytes approaches, and collects the demanded goods. Satisfied, they fade off into the hills, leaving you free to move on.
As you work your way through the hills, a band of troglodytes notices you and gives chase. As they charge, they shout _Death to the Empire!_ They've clearly mistaken you for Empire troops, and are clearly unwilling to let you correct their mistake.
You see a humanoid. It's like a human, but hunched, twisted, and has dark skin and piggy eyes. You've heard of these things from legend: it's a troglodyte. This is very strange. They were said to be extinct, and these are definitely very, very real.sTroglodytes are muscular, cunning creatures, and you're facing an awful lot of them. Hope you're ready for this ...
You search the troglodytes' stuff. They had a crude map, written on rough (and slightly bloodstained) paper. You take it with you.
The troglodyte village destroyed, you help yourself to their massive piles of loot. Their ill gotten gains become yours, including piles of gold, a beautiful broadsword, and a gold statuette.
A group of soldiers from Farport watches this bridge. They tell you they're making sure none of the slimes cross over to get to Farport. Not being slimes, they let you pass without comment.
The Nephilim thank you, saying in their purring way how the ogres often capture Nephilim for use as slaves (and food). By way of thanks, they give you a small flask. They then depart, a good deal more cautious than before.oYou knock and knock, but there's no response. The door is locked. You leave the hermit to his/her/its solitude.
You knock, but nobody responds. You yell that you have a message. The door opens a crack, and a filthy hand reaches out for it, grabs it, and pulls it back in. A sack of coins flies out, and the door shuts. The person inside yells _Come back in a minute!_
The door opens, and the filthy hand reemerges. _Great! Give it here!_ You give the message, and get your payment. The person says _I'll have another message for you in just a minute._
It's the same routine. You give the message and get paid. You hear furious yells from inside the hut. The door flies open, revealing a tiny, filthy old woman. Behind her, on a table by a small, smoky fire, you see a chess board. A game is in progress.
She screeches _You and that old bastard can go to Hell! I was cheated, I tell ya'! Cheated!_ The door slams shut so hard that a cloud of ancient paint chips flies off the walls.
A humanoid hand, so dirty you can't tell the race (or the species) of the owner, emerges from the darkness. It holds a folded and sealed message on ancient paper. _Take this over the mountains, and hurry it up!_
A group of ogres and bears tromps out of the woods ahead. They're too clumsy to set a good ambush, so they just charge. Oddly, it seems like the ogres are following the bear's lead, not the other way around.
You examine the bodies of the bears. One of them is larger, misshapen and lumpy, and, most interestingly, has an unusually large skull. It may have been an intelligent bear. It was certainly nasty and cunning enough.
You stare out at an unpleasantly familiar sight: you're back in Exile. You don't see any towns or settlements, but you know these trees and mushrooms all too well. You don't know whether you're near Upper Exile, or the Exile far below.
Although you don't see any towns from your vantage point, there is a crude trail heading off to the west. It soon fades out, but that's seems as good a direction to search for the Orb of Thralni as any.
The thieves must know you're here. A bunch of them are laying in wait for you.  They step out of the shadows, ready to intercept you.zA larger and better armed group of thieves coalesces from the trees. They seem to be serious about stopping you this time.
You search the bodies, trying to find some sign of who they are or where they're from. Each has a symbol painted on the chests of his armor: a gold square with several objects inside it. There's a crown, a sword, a potion, and five or six other items.
You meet an Empire patrol, out of the city of Golddale. They're hunting for troglodytes or ogres. As you're neither, although they're suspicious of you, they let you continue.
The mining operations have a large smelter here. Iron, gold, and silver are pulled from the stone by huge fires, some normal, some magical, and formed into bars to enrich the people of Golddale.
The wastes and ash left behind are dumped into the aptly named Sludge River. The goo and muck turns the water gray and ill smelling. Seeing the process makes you feel uncomfortable, at best. However, dealing with this isn't your job.rThis secluded valley is home to a variety of nasty, ravenous lizards. Two groups of them have decided to hunt you.
A small, quick band of troglodytes, far from home and looking to cause some damage, spots you. Bands such as this mainly make fast and vicious raids against isolated farms, but gladly bushwhack travelers when they get the chance. They attack.
You fill your packs with as much of the silver ore as you can carry, pretty much playing out the vein. This won't make you rich enough to retire, but the stuff will be worth enough to make it worth your while.
You've played the vein out. You emerge from the mine, happily lugging along your sacks of gold ore. When you get outside, however, you find the owners of the mine waiting for you. Having let you do their mining for them, they proceed to mug you.
You step carefully into the lair, and find something not at all surprising. It's a family of ursagi, and their goblin slaves/grooms. The inevitable combat occurs ...
Having defeated the monsters, you search their lair. There's shredded, rotting meat aplenty. You leave that. There's a bunch of gold. You take that. There's also a very nice mace. The looting done, you leave the grisly caverns.
You encounter a group of undead creatures, wandering through the trees looking for some unlucky soul to vent their hatred of the living upon. Deciding that they wish to devour you utterly, they charge you.
You suddenly realize that you're being watched. You look carefully, and see undead all around you, skeletons and zombies, watching you. When you spot them, they flee, disappearing into the woods. You've just been spied upon.
You emerge from the mine, packing a few sacks of valuable gold ore. You don't see anyone hostile. Looks like you got away clean.
An icy breeze blows through this eerie, dark forest. You look around, and would swear that you see shadowy shapes in the distance, circling and pacing you. You are  clearly being stalked ...
You plunge into the woods, searching for the source of the lights and singing. However, you don't reach it ... it seems to recede into the woods ahead of you. Suddenly, the light and music disappear, and you find yourself lost in a dark, shadowy forest.
As you start to pick some of the gems, you notice that the others start to disappear. You only grab ten of them before the rest are gone. You turn back and find that the trees have guards, and they're quite annoyed.
A patrol of human and slith guards approaches you. Before they leave, one of them says _Watch yourself out here. There are some packs of Nephilim bandits roaming about._
At first glance, is looks like all this small cavern contains is huge mounds of jumbled rubble. A closer look reveals that some of the _rubble heaps_ to the northeast are actually poorly disguised stone huts. Lithe, feline shapes walk among them.KYou back away from the settlement. Fortunately, the guards didn't spot you.
You charge. You don't get far before the guards raise an alarm. This isn't a very large camp, but there are enough Nephilim here to give you a good fight...
You walk along a narrow land bridge between two bodies of water, fresh to the south and stagnant to the north. At one point you stumble upon a large pack of rats drinking from the north pool. Normally, rats would flee you. These don't ...
You clean your blades, relieved to have ridded Upper Exile of another pack of huge, ravenous rodents. Unfortunately, you find no reward. Just the satisfaction of a good deed well done.
As you admire the view, your knowledge of cave lore enables you to spot a rough trail leading through the mushrooms to the north. It hasn't been traveled for some time.PThe remaining Nephilim scatter. The bandits' crude village is yours to explore.|
The ever present green, glowing fungus on the cave ceiling above is unusually bright here, making the nearby terrain quite visible. The view of the mushrooms to the north and the clear blue lake beyond it is very pretty. 
You rapidly loot the cache, and find a small pouch of gold in addition to the arrows. As you leave, however, you see a band of humans approaching. They don't look pleased that someone has found their old supply cache.
This narrow, twisting, winding corridor is lined with the discarded skins of large insects, and filled with the sound of alien chittering. You constantly feel your are under the gaze of multitudes of insectoid eyes.
In the small cavern to the north, you see hordes of chitrachs, the hostile alien carnivorous insects that have been migrating from the lower caves. A band of the hungry vermin runs up to devour you.
It looks like you've finally cleared out the chitrach infestation. This area shouldn't have any more troubles with them. Their lair is open for you to explore.
As you turn back from the dead end, you hear a bizarre, resonant keening from far to the east. As the sound echoes across the swamp, you look to see what's causing it ...eYou find the water incredibly refreshing. You all drink some, and walk away feeling highly energized.
A lot of water from the river to the east has been trapped here for some time, growing increasingly stagnant and foul. Normally, you would expect to hear lizard or bat noises in a cave like this. However, the tunnel is completely, eerily silent.
An Exile patrol approaches to warn you: _We'd watch out if we were you. There's been a lot of chitrachs wandering around these parts._ They tell you to keep an eye open for bugs, and leave.
You have slipped through a well concealed path among a forest of stalagmites, and found yourself on a beach dotted with small pink mushrooms. There is no sign of humanoids having been here before.
You boldly loot the temple, knowing as you do that such places often have powerful magical defenses. Your expectations are fully met ... the bodies of the monsters you slew rise up again to boldly fight you.oThe patch of wormgrass has not yet recovered from your prior depredations. Perhaps if you returned tomorrow ...
You reach the final cave in this chain, and find that the remaining ogres and Slithzerikai have banded here as a last ditch defense against your invasion. There's a considerable force ahead, and they look like they mean business.
This cave contains several crude slith nests, not occupied by friendly sliths like you've met before, but by the savage, hostile kind. It looks like only a small portion of the village's population is here, but they are fully prepared to attack anyway.
You don't get far into the cavern before you encounter a tight group of large, crude ogre huts. The ogres charge you as soon as they see you, bearing stone clubs and fierce, stupid expressions. 
You are at the southern end of a long tunnel, which is clearly occupied. Totems with skulls of all sorts (including human) mark the path, and garbage and rotten meat is strewn liberally about. You don't expect a friendly reception.
As you cross the bridge, you hear a female voice: _Erika has decided you are not welcome. Please turn back now._ You notice that no matter how long you walk, you don't seem to be getting any closer to the other end of the bridge. You turn back.
As you cross the bridge, you hear a female voice: _Erika has decided you may see her. Proceed straight ahead, and enter her tower from the south. Make any diversions from the path, and no guarantees are made regarding your safety.
The guards slain, you search the hovels along the path. Strangely, there is no treasure of any sort. The huts have been cleaned of anything of value, even metal. You wonder where they took it.
The holly hasn't quite grown back yet. When you shred through a patch like you did, you have to be patient. Try coming back tomorrow.
You emerge from Fort Emergence into the outdoors. A harsh yellow light from above blinds you, and the air smells strange. For a while, the wide-openness of the space above you is terrifying. Still, there's nothing to do but press on...
You reach the shore of what can only be a river. You see a fish in it. It's shiny and silvery, not the comforting and normal pale gray of cave fish. As you admire the view, several large, brightly colored slimes ooze out of the trees and approach you...
This is very odd. The Empire worked for years to slay all monsters on the surface, but here is a strange beast before you, a slime unlike any you've ever seen, bubbling and magical. It leaves a trail of dead plants behind it as it oozes.
This vale is filled with shedded, rapidly crumbling unicorn horns. The rocks have bits of dark fur on them where the beasts rubbed against them. In the distance, you think you can see protruding horns, and many eyes watching you carefully.
Suddenly, a herd of unicorns runs down into the pass and charges you. The vicious, unpleasant creatures have obviously pegged you as an easy meal.
You are at the south end of a narrow pass, winding its way through the mountains. This would be a very useful shortcut, but find no tracks or other signs of humans coming along here.
A group of brightly colored, bubbling slimes oozes along the ground towards you, leaving wide trails of dead ground as they go. They move unerringly (and quickly) toward you.
Something bizarre happens. A band of Empire soldiers approach you. The paleness of your skin immediately marks you as odd. Yet, when they get close to you, they look you over and then walk away without a word. They looked rather relieved.
You begin the sweat-inducing hike up into a narrow canyon. These mountains are far from civilization, but not unoccupied. Large, toothy lizards bask themselves in the sun on the slopes above you. Some of them look like they would find you a tasty snack.
Sure enough, a small band of lizards is hungry (and stupid) enough to risk your blades for a taste of your legs. Odd. Some of the lizards approaching you have a peculiar reddish hue...
This old stone bridge looks like it was hurriedly built, and then left behind when it outlived its usefulness. It's still safe to cross. Barely.
As you move farther up into the valley, you see less of the lizards, but the ones you do see are much larger. You also often see large scorch marks on the ground.
The dryad looks at you intently. She stares at your packs with such intensity you suspect she may be able to see through them. Then she looks at you angrily and stamps her foot. _You don't have anything pretty at all!_ She turns her nose up in the air.
_I have half a mind to take you and make you my slaves forever! But I'm a nice dryad! Just go away, and don't come back without something pretty!_ She waves her hand, and you fall asleep. When you wave up again, you're outside the grove. You feel funny.
You walk to the end of the cave, and find a storehouse of gold! There's a pot of coins, the newest minted a century ago, sitting in the middle of an empty lair. You debate whether to take the coins or not.
As you ponder the issue, however, you hear a throaty laugh. A small dragon, flanked by fire lizards, walks in to greet you! It laughs, and says _At long last, I can add to my horde!_ Then it attacks. At least the gold will be yours.
You examine the body of the drake, and find a delicate gold necklace stretched tight around its neck. Strange it didn't break. You remove it and take it with.
You present the dryad with the perfect flower. She smells it, twirls on one foot, and laughs. _Thank you! It's wonderful!_ Then she runs up and gives each of you a kiss on the cheek. Your skin tingles where her lips were. 
_Now, as a reward, I'll tell you a secret. Far to the north, near Calloc, is a place where trees grow in a square. Stand in the middle, and walk straight south, and you'll find a reward! Now go away._ She sits down to admire her flower. You slip away.
You try to enter the dryad's grove, but can't find a way in. Probably much safer for you, in the long run. Faerie creatures have been known to spirit people away...
She thinks. _Well, at least you're honest. I'll let you leave. This time. But it you come back, you better have something I'll find beautiful. Or else._ You quickly walk out, before you end up with a serious curse.yAn Empire patrol catches up with you and looks you over. They look very suspicious of you, but back off and let you pass.
The trees in this forest are withered, burned, and missing large chunks. The trails of gray, dead ground tell the cause: the slimes have been moving through here, destroying foliage as they go. Unhindered, they would kill this entire forest.
It takes some effort, but you clear your head and walk away. Eventually, you look back, and see the stone circle is still there, mysterious and welcoming.
With a concerted effort, each step an intense effort, you haul yourself away from the altar and out of the circle. As you do, you'd swear you hear a whisper: _Please. We can help you._
You walk forward and kneel. Without thinking, you put your hand on the cool stone. For the briefest of moments, it throbs with power, and you feel weak and light-headed. Then the feeling passes, and ...
Suddenly, there is new knowledge in your mind. It's as if it was there all along, and you only just remembered it. You now know the spell Restore Mind.
Again, you learn a spell from one of these mysterious stone circles. The spell Magic Map appears in your mind. You also feel more energetic than you've felt in a long time.
No strange new knowledge appears in your mind this time. Disappointed, you stand, only to find you're lighter on your feet. You move around a little, and find that your Dexterity has increased!
You start to move away, but remember how wonderful you felt the last time you kneeled at one of the stone circle altars. It's a struggle, but in the end you realize that it would be for the best to enter the circle ...
You start to move, but suddenly the circle undergoes a transformation! The sun shines brighter, the air is fresher, the birds chirp, and suddenly the altar seems infinitely appealing. You go to kneel without hesitation.
You leave the circle and hike off. After a bit, you look back, only to find the stone circle has disappeared! A patch of bare ground is left behind, with no sign that the ancient circle was there.
You pick up the odd looking rocks, and pocket them. As you turn, you see some people you were sure weren't there before. They immediately move to attack. These rocks must be more interesting than you thought.
You closely inspect the bodies of the mages who mugged you. You find something interesting ... all of them have small red eyes tattooed on the insides of their wrists.
You approach the strange stone, prepared for vandalism. Then you instantly find yourself outside the circle. Disappointing, but at least nothing worse happened.
As you climb up the valley, a shower of rocks hails down upon you from above! You look up, and see laughing goblins on the cliffs above preparing further volleys. There's little point in continuing. Bruised and bloodied, you retreat.
Your woodsman skills alert you that something is suspicious. Looking up, you see dozens of goblins on the cliffs above preparing to throw rocks down on you. You back away before your brains get knocked out.AThis valley, formerly infested with goblins, is now eerily quiet.
You search the mine, and find that the goblin's digging techniques, while crude, were quite sufficient the tap the rich veins in these tunnels. You see both gold and silver ore, waiting for industrious souls to knock it out of the walls.
While you have neither the skill or the time to start a mining operation, you are more than happy to help yourself to the silver nuggets and gold dust you find in a side chamber. You are now quite a bit wealthier.
You see what looks like a mine entrance to the north. It is guarded by a band of goblins, ready to make their final stand. They charge ...
You decline to buy alchemy recipes, and bid farewell to Bulon. Before you go, he tells you to _Be sure to watch out for them goblins!_
This stagnant, unpleasant marsh is the watering hole for the nearby goblin tribe. Indeed, you've come across a band of them letting their wolves get a drink.
You encounter a Nephilim patrol. The Nephilim have been terribly harassed by the ogres, Empire, and humans in general, so it's perfectly understandable that they attack you.
You encounter a Nephilim patrol. The Nephilim have been terribly harassed by the ogres, Empire, and humans in general, so they're about to attack, but then see you have a Nephil with your group. They give you the benefit of a doubt and move off.
You encounter a Nephilim patrol. They are about to attack, but one of them recognizes you as the group that helped defend them from the ursagi. They wave and move on.
As you move along the beach, you hear a ghoulish, growling laugh behind you. A few ursagi and their goblin slaves have cut you off from escape. They move in for the kill ...
The Nephilim have several huts here. The poor, scrawny creatures, beleaguered and harassed by years of ursagi and Nephilim raids, are nervous when you approach. You move away - they have little to offer you.&It is possible to ford the river here.wYou move up to help the Nephilim. They're fighting a very strong force. They're clearly very relieved to have the help.
Ursagi are far too dangerous foes to be trifled with lightly. You move away quickly, hearing behind you the din of battle and the screams of slain Nephilim.
These Nephilim have no trust left for anyone not of their own kind. They don't move to attack you, which is a relief, but they clearly have no intention of letting you in.
The Nephilim watch you nervously as you approach. They can never be sure whether a human will attack them or not. When they see you have a Nephilim with you, however, they let you come in.
The Nephilim watch you nervously as you approach - they can never be sure whether humans will attack them or not. When they recognize you as the group that helped them against the Ursagi, however, they gratefully invite you in.FThe glowing nettle patch hasn't grown back yet. Maybe in a day or two.
The flowers growing here are even more beautiful that the ones to the southeast. However, none of them are quite perfect enough to take with.
There are beautiful, breathtaking flowers growing all along this valley, exploding in intricate rainbow patterns of colors. Their scent fills the air. After years in the dark dullness of Exile, the sights and smells almost overcome you with emotions.
You stand at the southeastern end of a long valley. Looking up it, you see, growing among the rocks, many varieties of beautiful flowers. Their pollen wafts down to you on the wind, enticing you to climb up and experience them.
This forest is exceptionally beautiful. The trees seem nicely tended, and there's a great profusion of forest creatures frolicking about.
You pick a single flower, taking a bit of dirt with it so it doesn't die. You pause to admire it - it's absolute perfection in plant form, the curve of its petals elegant and the smell seemingly endless. You carefully pack it away.
You reach the village of the gremlins, surrounded by neatly tended rows of every flower you've seen in the valley. Irrational, irritable creatures they are, they decide to water the flowers with your blood.SYou encounter another bunch of green thumbed (figuratively and literally) gremlins.}You are not alone in admiring the flowers. A bunch of gremlins live in this valley, and they aren't at all inclined to share.
While exploring this seldom used tunnel, you find a section of floor where the mold has small boot-prints in it. There are also dried spots of what looks like blood. You follow the tracks for a while, but they fade out. Interesting.
You bend down to touch the glowing water. As you do, the glow lifts up off the water, and forms into some sort of shape. The shape is humanoid, but is so faint and unstable you can't make out what it is. When it has formed, it speaks:
_I tell you I know of you. I send a message. You are being sent ahead, but it is futile. You should run, and run far. But I can still give you this gift, in hope for you._ The shade waves its hand, and you feel an odd tingling feeling. Then it disappears.oYou back away. After a moment, the glow disappears from the water. You feel relieved that nothing attacked you.
You stand on a large stone bridge, built to carry troops and supplies across the river to Fort Emergence. Soon an army will cross here, in hopes of carving out area for the Exiles on the surface of the world.
To the north you see a huge, open cavern, dotted with recently built towns and settlements, populated with Exiles recently teleported from far below. To the west is the Portal Keep, where everyone up here (including you) arrived.~As you wend your way through the tall stalagmites choking this tunnel, you hear someone ahead grunt something to someone else.gYou spring to alertness, and just in time ... a band of goblins jumps out ahead, and charges after you!
A band of the many Exile soldiers patrolling this area approaches you. The paleness of your skin immediately identifies you as Exiles. They look you over and leave.
The stench of this corridor and the bones and trash scattered everywhere make one thing quite clear: there's a goblin infestation nearby.|The mighty drake is humored in the extreme that you would dare to attack it. It growls a few magical words, and aid appears.
You come upon a pack of massive, feral rats. You try to walk slowly by, hoping they won't take any interest in you. It doesn't work... 
The massive slime flows over the rock towards you. The air gets colder and colder the closer it approaches, until your noses and ears start to sting. The creature is totally silent, and implacably deadly. You wonder if retreat might be wise.
You manage to escape the lethal creature, easily outrunning it over the rocks. It disappears off into the tunnels. If you wanted to, you might be able to find it again if you returned later. Heaven knows why you'd want to.
After much hacking and chopping, all the bits of the creature stopped moving. Victory is yours. You can only hope people appreciate your ridding the cave of this beast.
You prod at the crude warren, ice flaking off the stones as you poke at them with a sword. Suddenly, white goo starts bubbling up through the cracks in the lair! As the air becomes intensely cold, the goo starts to form into one gigantic blob...
You see a familiar sight ahead of you: the Portal Fortress. Inside it is the huge teleporter which is the only route from Exile below to this huge cavern and back.  The energy of the place makes your scalp tingle even from here.SThis small patch of comfrey root is still exhausted. Perhaps if you returned later.
At first glance, it only looks like a lump of rock in the middle of the stagnant water. Closer inspection reveals otherwise: it's some sort of ancient shrine, worn to the point where its carvings are no longer legible.
You ponder for a moment who might have built the thing, and for who, and then leave it behind. It's only one of the multitude of mysteries and odd places dotted all over these caves. It's just another sign of some ancient race you'll never learn about.
To your disappointment, you find that the tunnel dead ends with nothing along its length more interesting that piles of rock and piles of ancient rat droppings. Nothing useful. You turn around to head back.
As you do, however, you hear squeaking ahead. Loud, nasty squeaking. You start to wonder if perhaps the makers of the rat droppings ever return to this secluded passage ...
This secluded passage seems dull in the extreme - yet another long gallery filled with scree and debris. The only odd details are the piles of cave rat droppings, and even they look old. Even the glowing roof fungus that lights these caves is sparse here.
A Vahnatai patrol approaches you. The look you over with their strange, alien eyes and wave you on. _Searching we are for bandits. Caution we think you should have._ They move away soundlessly.
This corridor is very silent and eerie, dotted as it is by all manner of totems and signs bearing dire warnings. This must be a strong group of bandits indeed if they can display their position so blatantly.~You decline to shop. Silverlocke nods. _That's all right, dears. Come back whenever you want._ You finish your tea and depart.
You back off. The Vahnatai warrior shakes his head in disappointment. Then, with a strange, keening howl, the Vahnatai plunge into the hollow. You hear combat for a while, and then only half of the Vahnatai emerge, bloodied, and head for home.
The Vahnatai treat their wounds, and approach you. _We give you thanks. The chitrach are being an old and bad foe to many of we._ After taking a few trophies, they depart.
When you steer your boat close, you notice that the rocks to the west have a narrow open path between them. With care, you could steer your boat through it.
A worn and haggard Empire patrol is following you. When they get close enough for a decent look, however, they turn and stumble away. They were close enough for you to see that their armor was pitted, as is by acid, and they were complete exhausted.
As you trudge through the swamp, you stumble upon a nest of giant snakes. Prey must be scarce around here ... they slither out to do battle with you.
You come upon a bunch of shacks at the edge of the swamp. The people here are swamp dwellers: burly, tough, and naturals out in the bayou. They couldn't care less that you're from Exile. They welcome you in for pots of snake stew and to trade tall tales.
They tell you they're basically snake hunters. They hunt giant snakes for their meat, skin, and venom. They mention that if you go south, wander around, and are really lucky, some snakes might attack you. They make this sound like a good thing.
The crops around here are mostly lost: dead plants in neat rows. Long trails of land have been rendered lifeless, probably by the slimes that are wandering everywhere. After some hiking, you come across a farmhouse.
It's abandoned. Some slimes have been inside it ... the floors are pitted and ruined. Someone has painted a simple, grim message on the front door: _Gone to Krizsan. No point out here anymore._ You turn away, leaving this somber sight behind.
A band of brigands guards this narrow bit of hills between the mountains and the shore. When they see you, they immediately move to guard the path.
As you get closer, you notice something very odd. The brigands have several of the brightly colored slimes writhing and sliding among their feet. However, the slimes don't attack them. In fact, the bandits and slimes seem to be traveling together.
A withered, gnarled old hermit waddles out of the hut, looking very angry at being disturbed. _Consarn it! Get off my island!_ With that, he waves a hand, curses you severely and storms back into is hut. You don't feel so good.
You reach the very southwest corner of the continent of Valorim, and have a perfect view of the ocean, stretching out far, far beyond view to the south and west. You walk out onto the sand, and feel the salt spray dotting your face.
After years in the caves, you had forgotten that something so awe-inspiringly vast could exist. Staring out over this huge distance gives you a feeling of both wonder and vertigo. Soon, however, it passes, and it's time to journey on.
You wander into the mine, and are soon not-too-gently escorted out again. Claim jumpers are a common hazard at here at the back of beyond, and nobody is taking any chances on fraternizing with strangers.
You move quickly away, eventually looking back to see the slimes digesting the rest of the soldiers. Oh well. Better to be a little bit cowardly than a lot dead.
With a joyous howl, you rush into the combat, fighting alongside the Empire troops. The slimes are unconcerned. All they know is that more food has just moved near them ...
The Empire troops are amazed, both that their lives were saved and that they were saved by Exiles. The captain says _Thank you, friends! We're from out of Delis. If you go there and tell Glydden what happened, she'll be sure to reward you._
An Empire patrol, exhausted and harried from constantly fighting slimes, approaches you. Although your pale skin clearly marks you as being from Exile, sworn enemy of the Empire, they give you only the most cursory of inspections before they wander away.
A band of brigands charges you, thinking you an easy target. What surprises you the most are the slimes that travel at their side, seemingly follow their commands. Very strange.
You clean the slime off your blade, and take one last your around the farm house. Anything that might have been useful there has been dissolved or eaten. There's not even fruit in the garden. You leave the mess behind.
You enter and look around. Many acidic slimes have been in and out of here, with the result that everything inside is ruined, and holes have been burned in the walls and ceiling. While searching, you look out the window, and find you've been surrounded.
Much to your surprise, even though your paleness and thinness marks you as, if not Exiles, very strange characters, the people in the farmhouses are happy to welcome you in and give you a meal.
They warn you not only about the slimes, but about brigands who somehow travel with the slimes without harm. Nobody knows where the things come from, but they're convinced the only way to deal with it is for humans to stick together as much as possible.
You approach the farmhouses, and a group of them come out to meet you. They're polite, and apologetic, and tell you that if you don't leave they'll try to kill you. They aren't trusting anyone at this point, let alone pale-skinned, weird, armed strangers.
You approach a farm only to find it has been destroyed. All of the buildings have been burned to the ground, and the slime' acidic chemicals have left dead trails through all the crops. You leave the carnage behind.
You hurriedly shell out some of your hard-earned loot. The goblins laugh at you, harsh, mocking laughs. Ears ringing, you move away to safety.
When the goblins see that their money isn't forthcoming, the mount their wolves and emit bloodcurdling howls. Then they charge after you ...
This is an all too familiar sight. It was a large, successful collection of farms until the slimes got to them. Now, it's wreckage and ruin. Not even the slimes found it worthwhile to stay here.
The road ends here. Beyond this points, the slimes have dissolved the roadstones, leaving a morass. Odd. Why would the slimes want to eat a completely inedible road?
The gray-haired patriarch of the clan pokes his head over the wall and yells _Nobody's comin' in here 'til all them slimes are gone! You ain't safe! Keep comin, and we'll kill 'ya._ You back away, in order to avoid slaughtering innocent, inbred townsfolk.
You decline to purchase any of the hill people's brew. They don't look offended. _More for us,_ their leader chortles. They march back to their hovels.
You reach the end of the valley. Slimes sun themselves on the rocks everywhere, and slide in and out of a multitude of caves and tunnels, all of them identical looking.eAs soon as you start moving forward, the slimes inactivity ends. They glide gelatinously towards you.
You reach the isolated glade, only to stumble upon a party of bathing dryads. They shriek when they see you. Fortunately, they then run off into the woods. Faerie creatures can do much worse when they want to. There's nothing else here.
These goblins won't be hassling travelers anymore. Their camp doesn't have anything useful - they must have hidden their loot somewhere. You notice that their tracks come from the north.
IThese slimes are dead. No doubt there's plenty more where they came from.
You strongly suspect there's something interesting here, but there's no way you could search all these caves yourself, being hassled by slimes every step of the way. Maybe there's some information you could find elsewhere that would help you here ...
Mandrake is a delicate, slow-growing root. This patch has not yet regenerated itself from your last visit. You'll have to come back later to get more.
You arrive at this remote isle, and immediately notice a lack of life. No birds chirp, no animals scavenge the shore. You only find one very unnerving sign of life - an absolutely perfect statue of a squirrel near the beach.
Steam rises from several vents in these hills, and you find a few natural hot springs. There must be some localized volcanic activity nearby.
You agree to help the enormous, ancient creature. You have a wait a day before his expected attackers arrive. In the meantime, it stays apart and aloof, making you camp outside its lair and not speaking with you.
Eventually, it moves out of its lair, each step making the ground vibrate under your feet. It says _The enemy approaches. Ready yourself._ Sure enough, not long after, a horde of drakes slithers into the valley, ready for blood.>You pay and cross the river. It's a quick, uneventful journey.
You pull your weapons from the creature's body and search its lair. It was not as wealthy as you had hoped. There's plenty of gold, though, and a beautiful set of plate mail. You take the stuff and leave, before the drakes it warned you about arrive.
The drake rises, having healed itself of its wounds. It flexes its enormous muscles, and, without a word to you, moves over to devour several of the dead drakes. Its lizard allies eat the rest. When the grisly meal is complete, it walks over to you.  
_I thank you for your assistance. You deserve a boon._ It moves into its lair and returns with a suit of plate mail held in its teeth, which it gives to you. _Our business is done. Go now!_ You have little choice but to obey.{The monks that survived your assault on their monastery have set up one vicious ambush, one final attempt to get vengeance.
With vicious intent and animal grace, they emerge from the trees and brush. No mercy will be asked, and none shown. They ask nothing more from the rest of their lives than to be able to kill you.
Your victory over the mad monks is complete. The last of this isolated band of psychotics lie dead at your feet. Your work is done here.
You're ambushed! You aren't attacked by humanoids or slimes, though, but by a vicious, muscled, lithe band of monks! They shout _Feisty Slap of Pain!_ and charge ...

The obelisk has several drawings sketched into it. There are four slimes, something that looks like a zombie, and, most unsettling, an enormous creature with many tentacles. You cannot understand the captions.

LizardFThe town weaponsmith bows to you, politely waiting to take your order.)_I am known around here simply as Smith._p_You may, if you wish, purchase fine weaponry here. In addition, you may sell your excess tools of destruction._9You are greeted by a grinning and helpful armor salesman.#_I am known in these parts as Pat._
_Traveling is dangerous these days. You should definitely purchase some armor to protect yourself. And, if you're protected enough already, you can sell excess armor back to me._{The toolsmith looks up from a rather intricate repair job. You can't help but feel the smith's face looks familiar somehow.*_I am known as Merry. Welcome to my shop._
_I and my siblings run shops such as this all over Valorim. I have a host of fine tools you can purchase. Also, I deal in used goods. Any supplies you no longer want you can sell to me._|A heavy-set man with a dark complexion is working hard rolling out pie crusts. His hands and clothes are covered with flour.DHe barely looks up from his work. _I'm Alfredo. Welcome to my shop._{_You look to be adventurers. I have all sort of rations for sale. Quality goods ... they'll hold up well while you travel._NThe town tailor sits at a wide table, pins in her mouth, hemming a long dress.JShe says something, but the pins in her mouth keep you from understanding.
She starts saying something about what she does and what she has for sale, but the pins in her mouth make her very hard to understand. You do make out the word _sale._
You meet the town fletcher, who sits at a counter covered with feathers, thin wood shafts, broken arrows, and other items of the trade.
You get a vacant look. _You know, I've been working so hard at fletching, for so long, I'm not sure I remember._ An awkward smile. _Sorry._c_I forget a lot of things, but I never forget that. I have missiles for sale. It's my life's work!_
j9/A small lizard looks up at you with beady eyes.
_Hiss._
_Hiss hiss._
_I don't know much about that._"_I'm afraid I only deal in armor._
Merry shrugs.AHe concentrates on the pie crust and pretends he didn't hear you.KShe looks confused, and says something you almost but can't quite make out.3_I'm afraid I forgot everything I knew about that._

_Well, that's what you adventurers do, isn't it? Break into creatures homes, slay them, and take their stuff, isn't it? Damned impolite, if you ask me._8He tastes the dough. It seems to meet with his approval.
4^trav^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Sure, I have to travel! I run shops like this all over Valorim. Others take care of them, usually, but I have to go all around anyway to make sure they're all in shape._)_In fact, you may see me at one of them!_

Cave Cow
Chicken
Sheep	Innkeeper
Sailor
AnaximanderaYou encounter a cat. It looks up at you with the arrogance and disinterest its kind is known for.0It stretches its back and bats at a bit of dust.
_Meow?_FA dog bounds up to you, rubbing against your legs, eager to be petted.;Pleased at the attention, it bounces up and down and barks.
_Woof! Woof!_
You meet one of the thin, pale cows that provide so much of the nourishment for Exiles. Their mushroom feed creates milk that is rank and meat that is worse, but, hey, at least it's edible.@The cow munches on a mushroom distastefully and looks up at you.
_Moooo._
QThis is a cow, a bovine provider of sustenance for a hungry and struggling world.
It looks up at you with tired, sad eyes, and gives you a long, world-weary look. You feel it is trying to say: _WHAT? I'm a COW!_
_Moooo. Mooo. Mooooooo. Mooo._9A chicken pecks and scratches the ground in front of you.&Scratch. Peck. Peck. Scratch. Scratch.
It pecks the ground further.WYou approach the sheep. It looks at you. You look at it. The air is thick with tension.
_Baaaa,_ it says.
_Baaaa! Baaa._*The innkeeper works busily behind the bar./_Eh. Just call me barkeep. Everyone else does._
_Don't have much here, out in the middle of nowhere. You can get a drink. Good beer, only a gold. Or, you can have a room. Only five gold. And no vermin._GYou meet a grizzled sailor, complete with tattoos, scars, and earrings.
_What business is it of yours._SThe sailor spits, and utters several very uncouth words. _I'm waitin' for a berth._
You greet Anaximander, commander of spying and special forces for Fort Emergence, and a very fidgety, nervous man. He has, in fact, grown more worn and weary since you last met him.
CHe gives a weary smile. _If you don't know by now, you never will._r_I am still working on instructions for you. The monsters on the surface, however, are making my job much harder._rYou greet Anaximander, commander of spying and special forces for Fort Emergence, and a very fidgety, nervous man.fHe nods. _I am called Anaximander. I have some titles and ranks, as well, but prefer not to use them._
_It is my job to give you instruction in your explorations of the surface world. It is a great honor that has fallen to you, to be given such a task._	It purrs.*It whimpers, afraid it has displeased you.
_Moooo?_ _Mooo. Never heard of it. Mooo._&The ground pecking continues unabated.9It doesn't respond. Sheep are notoriously stupid animals.
_Don't know much 'bout that._
The sailor doesn't know about this, and expresses a sadness at the inability to help by saying several very dirty words indeed.#_I have nothing to say about that._#_I have nothing to say about that._
11^meow^purr^0^0^0^0^0^99
(It looks up at you in confusion. _Meow?_

12^stic^ball^0^0^0^0^0^99
You toss a piece of your equipment. The dog runs, grabs it, and brings it back to you. It clearly could happily do this all day.(Hopefully, you have better things to do.
12^bett^thin^0^0^0^0^0^99COf course, then again, maybe you don't. You play fetch for a while.
13^mooo^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99lThe cow looks up, surprised, thinking perhaps that it's finally met an understanding member of its own kind.=Then it sees it's just you, and goes back to chewing its cud.
14^mooo^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Moooo. Mu. Mooo._
15^peck^scra^0^0^0^0^0^99GAfter a little while, it finds a seed. It eats it, and resumes pecking.
16^baaa^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99C_Baaaa?_ you say. _Baaaaa!_ it retorts. This goes on for some time.

_This fort is well concealed inside a hill. Simply exit out to the north, and you will be outside. What you will find there, we still have little idea._T_This is your task: to look out and report back. And, if you merit it, be rewarded._
20^look^repo^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Keep returning to see me, and to tell me what you have found. I will, in turn, give you instructions for how to proceed._ His expression grows stern.h_How we greet the Empire will determine much of the survival of Exile in the future. Care is essential._
20^care^esse^0^0^0^0^0^99i_Be careful. Don't commit grotesque crimes. Keep a low profile. Don't murder people. That sort of thing._
20^empi^exil^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Since the war with the Empire, we have heard nothing of them. Hopefully, this means they are rethinking how to deal with us. Perhaps, now that they know we have strong allies, we may negotiate with them._
_In particular, we may be able to get them to let us have some land on the surface. Your job is to let us know what's happening, so we can gauge if that is possible._
20^conc^hill^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes. Leave to the north, and you will emerge out of a hill on the surface. We believe that there is an Empire city to the southeast. You should go there first._
20^inst^expl^0^0^0^0^0^99
_At this point, we need to know what the Empire has been up to. Both we and our allies need to know. Soon, you should leave through the concealed hill entrance to the north, explore and report back._=_Of course, you can spend some time building strength first._
20^stro^alli^0^0^0^0^0^19a_Yes, we have strong, and powerful allies: the Slithzerikai and, more importantly, the Vahnatai._
20^buil^stre^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes, practice fighting and working as a team. Leave the fort to the south, and you will be in the caves. To the north east are lairs of both goblins and bandits. Somewhere in these offices is a map there._X_Go practice fighting if you want. But don't tarry too long ... all Exile waits on you!_
20^gobl^band^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The military has been too busy preparing to deal with them. They've been hoping some adventurers will solve the problem for them._

_The intelligent lizard people. Once, we fought great wars with them, before we realized we had more in common than we thought._
20^vahn^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^19
_The Vahnatai are the powerful and bizarre beings living far below us. They have a settlement in the caves to the north, called Ghikra._
_They were invaluable in winning the war against the Empire. Their magic is powerful, and their hatred of the Empire knows no bounds._
20^ghik^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^19u_To get there, leave Fort Emergence to the south, and head north through the caves. It's to the east of a huge lake._
20^grea^hono^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Much thought went into the decision who to send to the surface first. Eventually we decided not to send older adventurers ... their skills were well honed for the underworld, but not for the surface._w_Your inexperience may be a greater aid on the surface than you think. And, of course, we will be sending other spies._
20^othe^spie^0^0^0^0^0^99
_More than that I don't want to say. Suffice it to say that soon after you leave, others will fan out onto the surface, to gather information. Don't look for them, but rest assured they will find you._
19^inst^work^0^0^0^0^0^99
_These plagues of monsters on the surface that you described make it clear that I need to adjust our tactics. Keep exploring, and reporting back._n_We need to work even closer with our allies, find the culprits responsible, maybe even work with the Empire!_
19^mons^surf^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The surface world is being destroyed. This is the thing we last expected to happened. For years we in Exile dreamed of reaching the surface. We never imagined that when we returned, we may not want it._2_Outside this cave is our home. It must be saved._
19^save^home^0^0^0^0^0^99~_This must be our first goal. Our original goal, to return to the surface, can only be achieved if the surface is attainable._
19^empi^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_We are in the position where we may have to work with our old enemies, the Empire. What may come of that, I honestly cannot say._
19^thef^arti^0^0^0^0^0^20
_Recently, Heavens only know how, some thieves broke in and stole the Orb of Thralni, one of Exile's most valuable and powerful magical artifacts._r_Perhaps, if you have the time, you could investigate. Speak with Levy, to the east. He was caretaker of the orb._
19^towe^magi^1^308^5^0^0^20
_The Tower of Magi is the source of magic in Exile. There are mages, Solberg and 'X', who have agreed to give you spells as rewards should you achieve any mighty deeds on the surface.
Anaximander looks grim. _Somehow, the Tower of Magi was seized by mighty demons. We've lost control of the portal! We need you to analyze the situation. You should go to the Portal Keep immediately!_
19^port^keep^0^0^0^0^0^20
_The Portal Keep is a fort containing the teleportal between here and Exile. To get there, leave Fort Emergence to the south, and follow the road. Signs will lead you there._
19^form^murd^1^308^4^0^0^204He looks confused. Perhaps this hasn't happened yet.
_There has been a mysterious and bizarre series of murders in New Formello, in the caves to the far northwest. I have sent Flanagan to investigate, but somehow I feel that is not sufficient._
19^flan^suff^0^0^0^0^0^20
_He is a skilled man, but strange magic is involved. I would prefer you to go up to investigate as well. Somehow I think you will find things relevant to your quest._
19^expl^repo^0^0^0^0^0^
_Keep finding out what is happening, and, if you get the chance, keep the monster plagues from doing too much damage. If you work as well as you have been, you will continue to be rewarded._
19^rewa^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^20
_There are many ways we can reward you for bravery, persistence, and courage. In particular, we will give you magical spells and items. For the items, go to Levy._S_For the spells, you will need to go the Portal Fortress to be sent back to Exile._
19^levy^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^20O_He is the quartermaster for all exceptional goods. His office is to the east._
19^culp^resp^0^0^0^0^0^99
_It is key to find out who is ravaging the surface world, so we may deal with them and stop them before they destroy our home. Be sure, in your explorations, to look for evidence of who is responsible._B_Should you find anything that seems like evidence, go see Berra._
19^evid^berr^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Berra lives in the Mage's section of this fort. Should you find any evidence of who is responsible for the monsters, go to him and ask him about evidence. He will analyze it and research what it is._

Mazumdar
EvauA pale Exile, impeccably dressed and hair neatly cut, waits behind the counter. As you approach, he checks his notes. _I am Levy. How may I help you?_
_I am in charge of making allowances for those in Exile's employ. I also provide rewards for those who perform exceptional services._ He smiles. _In addition, I've been given a very valuable stewardship._sYou meet a small, heavy-set woman with a friendly attitude and radiant smile. She wears long, well-cared for robes..She shakes your hands. _I'm Marian. Hi there!_
_Well, let's see. I was doing research in Motrax's Cave, but everything up here seemed more important, so I came to Fort Emergence to help out._^You meet a Captain of the Exile army. He's very thin, somewhat hyper, and undeniably friendly.__I'm Ko. ... Ummm ... Captain Ko. ... Oh, just Ko. Greetings!_ He shakes your hands vigorously.N_Well, not much in the way of fighting. I just help Marian with the supplies._rYou meet a gaunt, severe man. His armor bears the insignia of a commander. He has a regal bearing, but cruel eyes.1He looks at you coldly. _I am Commander Johnson._*_I command all soldiers in this fortress._
A old, small, very round woman stirs a pot of savory lizard stew. She is surrounded with enough kitchen implements and supplies to feed an army, which is, you suppose, her job.
 _Welcome, children. I am Elise._x_I provide hot meals to all my children. I also, if asked very nicely, provide rations for troopers going out on trips._hYou meet a young, scrawny man with short, sandy brown hair. He bows respectfully to you as you approach.%_Greeting, adventurers! I am Gordon._{_Well, I'm sort of the servant for the guest quarters. I sort of keep everything clean, prepare meals, that sort of thing._
A young, lithe woman with dark skin moves lithely about the room, performing various martial exercises. A vicious looking curved sword is sheathed at her side. This person is clearly capable of being quite lethal.zShe walks over and gives you a stiff, sharp, not entirely respectful bow. _I am Yanmitho, the trainer for Fort Emergence._
She looks at you with distaste. _I am here to train soldiers to the best of my ability. I can also train ... others._ She says 'others' with great disdain. You can't help but guess her contempt is aimed at you.
You meet a small, bent wizard, heavy with years. He is poring over a thick book, researching esoteric fields you could never begin to comprehend.aHe looks up at you. It is clear his mind is wandering in realms far away. He croaks _I am Berra._Y_I mainly concern myself with doing research. If only the facilities here were adequate._
This woman is quite young, probably in her mid-twenties. Yet, she radiates power well beyond her years. She levels a piercing gaze at you.-_I am Mazumdar, Head Mage of Fort Emergence._H_I coordinate all magical activities that take place in Fort Emergence._uThis young mage's robes were probably clean this morning. Now, they have bits of fur and tiny clumps of dung on them.\She curtsies, self-consciously brushing fur and such off her robe as she does so. _I'm Eva._
_I'm here to research the flora and fauna of the surface world. We magically summon samples from the surface world, examine them in their cells, and teleport them back up._
Levy looks confused.#_Sorry, pal. Can't help you there._
Ko fidgets uncomfortably.>Commander Johnson looks annoyed. _What are you talking about?_
She smiles, and says nothing.
Gordon looks confused.
Yanmitho looks impatient.
He grunts in confusion.
_I don't know about that._)Eva shakes her head. _Never heard of it._

21^thra^sphe^1^308^6^0^0^99
_An irreplaceable and ancient artifact. It gives its possessor the power of flight._ He flashes you another small, tight smile. _If you ever need to borrow it, be sure to give me a request._@_The only artifact known to give the power of flight. Gone now._
21^borr^requ^0^0^0^0^0^99hHe smiles smugly. _Request denied. Perhaps if you try again later ..._ You resist the urge to punch him.
21^stol^gone^1^308^6^0^0^99
_What do you mean?_
_There was an explosion in the middle of the night. We went to the orb's vault, and it was ravaged and empty. There was no way anyone could have snuck in. We think the thieves teleported in!_
21^thie^tele^1^308^6^2^0^99
_It's the only way they could have entered. Fortunately, Seles, Exile's best teleportation expert, came here to investigate, and she agreed with this guess. She said that anyone interested in tracking the thieves should go see her._e_Doesn't matter, now that you recovered it. Well done. We've authorized you to keep it. Use it well._
21^sele^expe^0^0^0^0^0^99G_She lives at the Portal Keep. She might help someone recover the orb._
22^rese^motr^0^0^0^0^0^99
She grows sad. _Yes. Poor old Motrax. There were five dragons in Exile, and Motrax was the oldest and kindest. In the Empire War a band of those bastards tried to slay him.

22^fort^emer^0^0^0^0^0^99

_Yep. It takes a lot to feed an army, after all. By the way, you the lot that's going up to the surface? If so, the stuff in the side supply room is for you. Help yourselves!_'_It's also there for your storage use._
23^stor^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99x_If you have too much stuff, leave the excess in the side storeroom. We'll watch it to make sure nothing happens to it._
24^comm^sold^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes. I command soldiers. Which you aren't. Someday, we're going to have to slay all those Empire bastards, and when they do, it'll be the soldiers who do the work._
24^slay^bast^23^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes, that's right. Slay all of them. And you and your other 'Unspecified Services' wastes of air will be no good to anybody._ c_It's your turn now. But someday, it'll be up to the men. Not the kids. So go away._ He looks away.
24^bunk^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99-He looks startled. _Who told you about that?_
24^sand^xxxx^10^0^42^1^0^99

25^meal^chil^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Once I had children of my own, but they grew up and left. After that, I had the skills to cook for a horde, but no horde to cook for._
25^troo^rati^102^0^0^0^0^99
25^hord^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Now I cook for a somewhat older horde. Exile troops eat a lot, but not much more than my nine kids did!_ She chuckles at that. She seems like she's about to tell you a story about her family, and then thinks better of it.
26^serv^clea^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Well, when important guests such as yourselves come, they expect to be treated well, and with as much luxury as we can summon, and that sort of thing. Unfortunately, there's one problem._
26^meal^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
He looks nervous. _Ummm, there's a bit of a problem with that. The fort is sort of not entirely ready, and I don't have the supplies up here to cook yet. Perhaps if you went to see Elisa?_
26^elis^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99`_She runs the main kitchen, in the southwest corner. She gives lots of food to anyone who asks!_
26^impo^gues^0^0^0^0^0^99

27^unsp^serv^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Unspecified Services! Pfaugh!_ She spits. _A ragtag band of untrained adventurers, amateur spies, and mixed hangers on. We soldiers train hard and die for our cause. You wander around aimlessly, and expect respect._j_And yet, King Micah gives the first contact with the surface to your undisciplined lot._ She spits again.
27^king^mica^0^0^0^0^0^99m_It is not to such as me to question the wisdom of my monarch._ She pauses and thinks. _Even if he is wrong._

28^rese^xxxx^1^307^3^0^0^99
_Devising immensely powerful spells, communicating with beings beyond your comprehension, gaining absolute power. Nothing you could possibly understand. You're probably just here to waste my time._

29^tria^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The Triad consists of the three greatest mages of Exile. They are in charge of all things magical. Unfortunately, they tend to not want to let power out of their control._c_For that reason, our resources are nowhere near what they could be._ She grins. _With exceptions._

CaroluYou meet an aging mage in flowing, violet robes. Although he is only middle age, he looks worn well beyond his years.
7He gives you a weary bow. _I am Solberg, of the Triad._
He gives a weary, sad smile. _I serve Exile in my capacity as member of the Triad. Alas, I have endured many ordeals in this position._
You encounter a wizard wearing long, rich violet robes. A heavy cowl covers the mage's head. You can't make out any details of his (or her) face in the shadows inside. It's pretty creepy.NA reedy, whispery voice emerges from the folds of the cowl. _I am called 'X'._
_I am of the Triad._
A short, middle-aged woman with heavy chain armor watches the front gate. She keeps a short but wicked looking spear close at hand.fShe looks from the gate over to you. _I am Ilona._ Her voice has a heavy accent you can't quite place.
_I am watching the front gate. Not a risky job, it is true, but one the needs to be getting doing._ Her speech is very strange.dYou meet a young woman with long dark hair. She doesn't seem to be too interested in talking to you.
_Thereza._*_I'm with Unspecified Services, like you._cYou meet a burly man with a lot of hair and a lot of gut. He looks you up and down as you approach.?_I'm Flanagan, with Unspecified Services. Pleased to meet you._%_I'm sort of an investigating agent._
You encounter a very large, very pudgy calico cat. As you approach, it looks up at you. You are surprised to see intelligence in its eyes.f_I,_ it proclaims regally, _am Cheeseball. Not the name I would have chosen for myself, I assure you._
6_I am, I regret to say, a familiar. Not of my choice._pYou meet a professional looking mage in well trimmed clothes. Traces of gray are starting to appear in his hair._He walks up and formally greets you. _I am Kelner, chief administrator of the Portal Fortress._
He waves at his surroundings. _I coordinate all comings and goings for the Portal Fortress. It's sort of a promotion from my Tower of Magi post._
You meet a short, portly man with short blonde hair. His fingers are stained with ink, and it looks like he has several pen cases in his pockets. He hold a pen in his hand now, with an unusual rainbow design on it."_Greetings! I am Walner the sage._
_Well, as soon as I heard about the surface portal, I came here to see what the fuss is about. Sages are always welcome wherever they go. And while I wait, I study in the library._
This is an archer of Exile, polishing a fine yew bow with practiced fingers. His armor bears the insignia of a captain, and his face bears the expression of one who'd rather be somewhere else."He nods brusquely. _Captain Jake._BHe seems irritated at the interruption. _Going to Fort Emergence._
This is a very tall, dignified woman, her face and short, dark hair starting to bear the signs of middle age. She is currently grinding up some herbs and roots.9She stands to greet you. _I am Carol, of the Hamer clan._vShe indicates the herbs and poultices that surround her. _I am a healer, brought near the surface to exert my skills._'Solberg says _I'm not sure about that._$No sound emerges from the dark hood.%She smiles and shrugs apologetically.
1She says _I'm not authorized to talk about that._
He belches negatively.
_Meow?_
_I don't know about that._
_I don't know about that._
He shakes his head.
She gives you a confused look.
31^endu^orde^28^24^0^0^0^99
_For many years, I was forced to hide in a tower far out in the nether caves of Exile, for my own protection. The years of my life I lost in that prison I prefer not to think upon._z_The latest ordeal being the horror of the Tower of Magi's destruction. I lost many friends. I prefer not to speak of it._
31^tria^posi^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The Triad of Magi oversees all magical activity in Exile, makes sure dangerous knowledge doesn't become widespread, and watches for any potentially deadly experimentation. Such a position is not without risks._M_In addition, I am supposed to give magical rewards to those who merit them._
31^horr^dest^0^0^0^0^0^99V_You saw the effects of the destruction as closely as I did. I wish to forget it all._
31^dang^know^0^0^0^0^0^99
_We try to control who can cast Kill spells, and the like. If unscrupulous persons obtained certain spells, we could all be in great danger._
31^expe^risk^28^24^0^0^0^99
_We need to keep a close eye on experiments, to make sure nothing deadly gets loose. In particular, I watch my old adversary, Linda._
_We saw, in the destruction of the Tower, our greatest risk and greatest failure. By losing track of Linda's experimentation, we lost so much, including Mahdavi, one of the Triad itself. I mourn for us all._
31^lind^adve^28^24^0^0^0^99
_She has a dangerous predilection for summoning nether creatures. This tendency was what first drove me into hiding for many years. Now that she is back in the Tower, I am very nervous indeed._kHe seems to age before your eyes. _I curse the woman. I am glad for the fate she met. I'm sorry, but I am._

z_We restrict the flow of magical knowledge, so that the weak and untrained do not grasp hold of that they cannot control._
_We keep the weak from knowledge that would damage them. A wise choice, considering the recent unpleasantness at the Tower of Magi._
32^weak^untr^0^0^0^0^0^99l_If one gains magic he or she cannot control, only blood will be produced._ 'X' emits a dry chuckle at this.

33^fron^gate^0^0^0^0^0^99
_It is not like the north gate. That is the way to the outdoors, and much more heavily guarded. If the Empire finds us, the north gate is where it will, how you say, hit the fan._
33^spee^acce^0^0^0^0^0^99VShe looks embarrassed that you mention it. _I am from a long ways away. My apologies._
33^cave^exil^0^0^0^0^0^99

34^unsp^serv^0^0^0^0^0^99

34^assi^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99^_Your job is to do recon on the surface. I am the contact for the others being sent up there._
34^othe^xxxx^23^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes, others. You didn't think something so important would be left to just you, eh?_ She pauses. _And more than that I am not cleared to say. Sorry._
She turns away.
34^rese^mili^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The military resents us because they don't control us and we do many things better than them. So don't expect much help from them._
35^unsp^serv^0^0^0^0^0^99]_You know, everyone who works for Exile but doesn't have a specific pigeonhole. Unspecified._
35^inve^agen^1^308^4^0^0^99
_Well, I'm too big and loud to be much of a spy! So I wait here. Then, when something goes wrong or gets weird, I'll go look it over and figure out what's going wrong._ He taps his head. _I got more up here than you might think._i_Well, right now I'm investigating a pair of messy murders. I'm glad you're here. I could use some help._
35^mess^murd^1^308^4^4^0^99
_Not long ago, two men here went north to do some surveying. Not long after that, there was an earthquake. Not long after that, they were found in a cave up there, dead. I sure could use another brain to find out what happened._
_Well, I don't think we'll find out much else about those earlier murders, but I'm waiting here, just in case something else happens._

36^lous^time^0^0^0^0^0^99
_First, I had to hide with him in some crummy smoky evil tower for years. Then I had to follow him all over the place. No catnip! No mates! No relaxing! How can you not pity me?_ He spits a hairball in irritation.

_I spent most of my magical career there, first in training and then as administrator. I finally got transferred up here, much to my relief._
He shakes his head. _I am relieved that I was able to get myself away from there before the evil finally came to the surface. However, I will always mourn for the many friends I lost._
37^tran^reli^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Once, years ago, a mage named Linda performed certain very dark experiments. I trained there at the time, and was able to help some adventurers purge the evil she brought._
_Later, when I was administrator there, Linda returned and I sensed that old habits were starting to return. So I pulled strings and came here. It was not a situation I wanted to deal with anymore._
37^lind^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Linda, formerly of the Triad, master wizard. She brought a demon into the tower once, and only with great effort was it repelled. Never trusted her, never will._

_Sorry, I meant no disrespect._
37^exil^surf^1^308^5^0^0^99
_It's a tough job running this place, so many people and so many supplies coming up to keep track of, and some people wanting to return as well. But it beats being in the Tower._
_Well, now that the Tower is gone, there's an interruption in the transit. Thus, I have to work day and night figuring out how to restore the connection. Damnably difficult job._
37^retu^xxxx^1^308^5^0^0^99m_Sometimes people can return. You should speak with Seles. She's by the portal. She coordinates all of that._pHe frowns. _Nobody is returning, however, until the Tower is restored and the portal becomes operational again._

38^surf^port^0^0^0^0^0^99
_As you can guess, everyone wants to come up here. The chance to see the surface again is making people frantic. However, only so many can be brought up at a time._MHe grins. _Of course, when getting a berth, it helps to have certain skills._

38^alch^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes indeed, and my secrets are for sale. For example, I know an excellent, very old recipe for curing potions using holly. Holly is a surface plant, but since you can go up there, you may be able to find some._
_I can also teach you a recipe for healing potions using good old comfrey. Let me know if you'd like to purchase either recipe._

A neatly dressed mage stands between you and the towering pillar of energy that is the surface portal. She holds a thick notebook. The energy of the portal makes her hair stands almost straight up.;_Welcome, adventurers. I am Seles, overseer of the portal._
_My title is Portal Overseer. I look after and steer those emerging, and when someone wants to use it, it is I they must give there request to, and I who gives permission._
You meet an aging, grizzled old veteran. He walks ceaselessly through the fort, appraising the supplies, soldiers, walls, and everything else with a long practiced eye.*He extends a callused hand. _Call me Tor._
_Supplies are my life._
You meet a small, heavily muscled man with dark skin and a quick eye. He wears all black, and has an outlandish hat and a wicked sword.(He bows sharply. _I am Julio, traveler._3_I'm an explorer. I make maps, that sort of thing._]A young female mage sits before you, reading a scroll. She looks irritated at your intrusion.
_I'm Denise. Leave me alone._q_Look, what do I have to say or do to get some studying time alone? As if I didn't already have enough problems._
This mage looks more like a salesman than anything else. He holds a large sack at his side, which bulges with all manner of odd-shaped things. As you approach, he displays a rather predatory smile.)_I am Brantford the mage. And collector._(_I collect valuable items of all sorts._
Seles the mage stills stands in front of the portal. However, the portal flickers ominously and has occasional tinges of an angry red shade. She no longer looks unconcerned about its proximity.PShe nods nervously, casting a worried glance at the portal behind here. _Seles._U_I am still the Portal Overseer, a much more difficult job since the Tower disaster._
You stand, edgily, before the most powerful of the Vahnatai: the archmage Rentar-Ihrno. She was Exile's greatest help in winning the Empire War. She looks at you curiously.rShe doesn't approach you. She doesn't seem to feel you merit much of her attention. _I am Rentar-Ihrno,_ she says.
She sighs, resigned to waste time talking to you. _I am Ihrno to my people, and mistress of Ghikra. I do my research and protect our treasures._
You approach a large, perfectly flawless blue crystal, about a foot and a half high. As you do, you feel peculiar, as if someone other than you is inside your head. You hear a gentle voice in your mind: _Greetings._RThe smooth voice in your head continues. _I am Glantris-Bok. I am a Crystal Soul._2_I exist for only one purpose: to help my people._
This is a perfectly flawless blue crystal, about two feet high. As you approach it, your head begins to hurt. You feel pressure inside your skull, as if someone just pushed their way in. A harsh voice in your mind says _Speak._
There is a strange, scratchy, discordant sensation in your head. The voice in your mind is loud and disturbed. _I ammmmmm Vyvvnas-BOK!_ You've heard of it! This is one of the Crystal Souls stolen by the Empire.Q_I am here! HERE!_ The rough presence in your mind is getting very uncomfortable.
You meet a Vahnatai male, wearing the translucent softly glowing poncho that is the standard dress for their race. He is carving a gentle spiral of crystal with a small, elegant knife.`He looks up from the crystal. You think he's smiling, but you aren't sure. _I am called Koriba._i_I shape crystals. They are having many uses._ Like most Vahnatai, his grasp of your tongue is very poor.
_That's definitely not my job._+Tor doesn't know what you're talking about.
He shrugs.(_If you can't talk sense, please leave._
He smiles enigmatically.-_I rally don't have time for this right now._
She looks at you blankly.
:The voice in your head is perplexed. _I know not of that._
_Eeeeeee!!!!_
He shakes his head.
41^port^over^0^0^0^0^0^99v_It's a tricky job. So many want to use the portal, for so many reasons. Do you wish to request permission to use it?_
46^port^over^1^308^5^2^0^99
_A horrible job, now. It's taking all my energy to keep what's going on in the Tower of Magi now from destroying the portal. Someone can teleport down there now, but they won't be able to for long. Gods help us if nobody can do anything._
_A grim job, since the Tower disaster. Nobody will be going down or coming up for a while. You can still request permission to use the portal, but I don't think there's much I'll be able to do for you._
41^requ^perm^108^0^0^0^0^46
46^towe^disa^1^308^5^2^0^99
_We need to get someone down there, and fast, to take the Tower back from the evil creatures and stabilize the portal. Otherwise, the portal will be destroyed, along, probably, with most of Exile._
_The Tower disaster cut the portal loose at the Exile end, and it'll take a lot of work to anchor it again. Nobody is going down and coming up for a while. I hope you can make peace with the Empire, or we will have to fight a war with no reinforcements._
41^tric^reas^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The portal takes a lot of energy, and can only send so many people in a day. Most of its energy goes to bringing up as many people as possible. Access for other purposes, most of which are generally deemed frivolous, is limited._R_That is why anyone who wishes to use the portal must request permission from me._
41^friv^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Visiting friends and family, retrieving something you forgot, that sort of thing. Portal energy is just too limited to spend on non-vital things._
41^thra^sphe^0^0^0^0^0^46
_I don't know who stole it, or why, but I do know where they went. You see, any teleportation up here affects the portal, and I can cast spells to tell who blipped where and why and adjust this portal to compensate. Thus, I can help you find the thieves._
42^supp^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99nHe grins proudly. _Yep. Farmed for a while, but looking after goods is something I've always had a knack for._
42^life^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^990_Well, half of my life. Carol's the other half._
42^farm^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Tough work. Disease. Nephilim. Salamanders. Just for a few mushrooms. Major pain. Sold the farm to the field hands and left it at that._
42^caro^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99z_My wife. She's a healer, and a fine one at that. She's up here with me. If she wasn't, well, I wouldn't be here neither._
42^good^knac^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Well, you're too young to remember, but once I gave supplies to every single person who entered Exile. They teleported down, and I gave 'em a knife and some food to get 'em by until they found work._J_It was good work. And this is good work too. Really appropriate, I mean._
42^real^appr^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Well, once I gave supplies to everyone who came down from the surface. Now I take care of the goods for everyone comin' up! Symmetry, ya' know?_
43^expl^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99~_I traveled from one end of Exile to the other, don't you know, looking for a route to the surface. I swore an oath, you see._
43^maps^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_You probably have one of my maps. I'm the one who mapped out these caves up here. I also made the only map we have of the area above. We haven't even been up there, but we have a map._&_Bet you're wondering how we did that!
43^wond^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Magic! A mage managed to give me a split-second magical view of the land above Fort Emergence, from way, way up. From that, I made the map! Pretty amazing, huh?_
43^amaz^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99a_Amazing, indeed! I drew a whole map, from a tiny glance. Excellent work, if I do say so myself._
43^surf^oath^0^0^0^0^0^99
_A sacred oath! I promised I'd never rest until I saw the light of day again, good honest sunlight. And it looks like I'll finally get the chance, even if I have to sneak out through Fort Emergence to do it!_
43^snea^emer^0^0^0^0^0^99
_They aren't letting anyone out until they know it's safe, they say. Well, hell with that! I've been in prison down there for long enough. If I die, fine. I can deal with that._#_But damn it, I'll die in the sun!_
44^stud^time^0^0^0^0^0^99d_Yeah, studying time! You don't think everyone gains magical abilities by killing monsters, do you?_
44^prob^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
She slams her book shut in anger, but not anger at you. _I left an amulet down in the Tower of Magi, a valuable focusing aid! They rushed me along to come up here, and I forgot it!___Now, that bureaucrat Seles won't let me retrieve it, and I can't go on to my post without it!_
44^bure^sele^0^0^0^0^0^99c_I hope she gets an infection. A special sort of infection._ She gives an unnervingly wicked smile.
44^magi^abil^23^0^0^0^0^99
_Some of us don't want to go around butchering poor creatures all the time. We get our skill through good, honest work. So buzz off!_
44^amul^retr^109^0^0^0^0^99
44^post^xxxx^23^0^0^0^0^99y_Look, I'm Unspecified Services, like you. I can't talk about it. Come to think of it, I probably shouldn't talk to you!_
45^coll^item^28^40^0^0^0^99
He sighs. _Alas, the loss of the Tower of Magi as a place of business cost me valuable location and inventory. However, you can still purchase my wares, and sell me excess supplies._
_Yes! Many interesting souls come through the Tower of Magi, and I collect goods from them for resale. Perhaps you would like to purchase some of my goods? Or sell me some trinkets you no longer have need of?_ 
45^towe^magi^28^40^0^0^0^992_Sad business, that. But one must soldier on, eh?_-_A wondrous place. Pity about the weirdness._
45^weir^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Oh, one hears rumors of odd goings on. Although I have accumulated some magical skill over the years, I don't concern myself with such things. I am a businessman._

Brantford's Goods
45^sell^trin^13^0^0^0^0^99
He appraises your items, shaking his head sadly. _If you'd brought me this stuff last week, I could make much better offers. However, I'm in a generous mood. Perhaps we might still work something out._
47^ihrn^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Ihrno is an honorary title. It means 'person of great learning.' It is appropriate that I should bear it, as I am the most magically talented of my people._
47^mist^ghik^0^0^0^0^0^99
_When the war against the Empire was won, we decided we should maintain contact with the beings we shared these caves with. That is the purpose of Ghikra - the conduit through which communication between our peoples shall pass._h_I am here to control it. And to guard it. And we also wish to watch your efforts to reach the surface._
47^prot^trea^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Our Crystal Souls, the spirits of our ancestors in physical form, and even more powerful and knowledgeable than myself. I hope to be one myself. Alas, others covet them._\_We have two of them here, and guard them totally. However, we do allow some to visit them._
47^peop^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99o_The Vahnatai are my people. We live in the caves far below you, and wish only to live safely and undisturbed._
47^guar^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99D_As the Empire taught us, we have great treasures others may covet._
47^empi^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_We feel not all humans are bad. The Empire humans, however, have proved to be foes to us. It is good they are on the surface, away from us._
47^surf^xxxx^1^309^8^0^0^99
b_Be careful on the surface. The Empire is still a strong foe, and we will not be able to aid you._
You tell Rentar-Ihrno of the crystal shards you found under the giant's fortress. She isn't impressed. _Many besides us use crystal magic now. I know nothing of what happens up there now._
47^allo^visi^2^41^9^0^0^99
She looks uncomfortable. _They have said they wish to see humans who visit. I dislike letting humans near them, but their wishes are paramount._ She makes a few hand motions. 8_You may now pass the barriers that keep you from them._
47^safe^undi^0^0^0^0^0^99$_Honestly, who could wish for more?_
47^magi^tale^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Great are my powers._ She gets a peculiar expression on her face. It's difficult enough telling how a Vahnatai is feeling under normal circumstance. Sometimes, it's simply impossible.DThe moment passes, however. She simply says _Do not trifle with us._
48^crys^soul^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I lived in physical form twelve hundred years ago. Then, at the point of death, I was shifted into this form to exist for millenia more in service._
48^help^peop^0^0^0^0^0^99
_What could be greater? Long after you are dust, I will still be serving my race. I will remember you, and someday, a thousand years from now, I will tell a young Vahnatai of your struggles to instruct him._
,_That is what I do. I remember, and advise._
48^serv^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^998_To help my people. To learn, and remember, and advise._
48^reme^lear^0^0^0^0^0^99S_In this form, I remember everything I hear, everything I see. It is a great gift._
48^advi^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99z_Often, my people come to me for advice on what to do. I always give it. They do not always take it, but usually they do._b_This is why I told Rentar-Ihrno to let you see me. There is information I wish to impart to you._
48^info^impa^0^0^0^0^0^99
The voice in your head gets quiet, so that you have to struggle to make it out. _When you reach the surface, and deal with the Empire as it is today, remember Ourubourous._
48^ouru^xxxx^23^0^0^0^0^99
_Ourubourous was the snake of legend, that was so mighty it encircled the world, and ate its own tail. It was all-powerful, and yet devoured itself. As you see the surface, remember that image._h_And that is all I have to say on the subject._ The voice in your head fades away. The presence is gone.
49^empi^xxxx^23^0^0^0^0^99
Your head is filled with an intense, horrifying screeching. You back away, in horrible pain. Then it subsides. But the presence in your head is gone.
49^here^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99dUnexpectedly, the voice in your head calms. _Apologies. I am still recovering from my imprisonment._
49^impr^reco^0^0^0^0^0^99
_They I ... I ... I ... may not ... must not mention tested on me, twisting my thoughts on myself, to get me to BREAK TO SERVE THEM_ The volume of the voice is agonizing. Mercifully, it calms down.&_Now I lend my paranoia to my people._
49^para^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Strange that must sound, but I am my people's fear. They must share their caves and their scarce resources with you humans and others. And the ... the ... the bad people are on the surface above us all._
_I am their constant reminder._
49^cons^remi^23^0^0^0^0^99
_I remind what some want to do to us! WHAT THEY DO TO ME ... ME ... WHAT CAN ALWAYS HAPPEN!_ You back away under the force of this poor mad being's thoughts.
_We are strong but weak. Everyone must guard everyone from everyone._ It pauses. _Now I am tired. Leave me. Humans are often bad._ Then there is silence.
50^shap^crys^0^0^0^0^0^99
He holds up the spiral he was working. It catches the dim light and sparkles beautifully. _Is there ever anything so lovely, so orderly?_
50^uses^havi^0^0^0^0^0^99>_It is the basis of our artisticness, and of our magicalness._
50^arti^xxxx^1^41^5^0^0^99oHe looks somber. _Yes. I had a best example which is not here for showing. It was a statue, but it was stolen._W_Yes, as you saw in the statue you returned to me. Again for which I give many thanks._

50^ston^soul^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Soul Crystals, not to be confused with Crystal Souls. They are used for certain spells to trap creatures to be called forth later. Very strong._
He looks at you slyly. _In fact, certain such spells I am not forbidded from making for purchase to outside people. For prices_

From a ways away, this looked like a formidable Vahnatai warrior. When you get close, however, you see that it isn't actually there. It's very slightly translucent. It looks at you as if it were alive, however.'It stares at you perfectly impassively.HIt says in an emotionless voice, _I have been left here with a message._CYou meet a portly bearded man in nondescript robes. He looks bored.*_Oh, hello. I'm Habecker. Can I help you?_H_Well, I was hired to research for the fort. Which is why I'm so bored._
This Vahnatai is tall and spindly even by Vahnatai standards, over seven feet tall and twig thin. He sits in front of the fire pit, carefully polishing an amazingly sharp wave blade.>_Welcome! It is a pleasure to meet humans at last! I am Ohar._e_I craft weaponry. Our blades are very different from yours, and yet made under the same principles._
You see an ancient and withered mage, hunched back in a large, carved chair. He  was meditating while staring into a small brazier. Now he looks up at you as if he was expecting you.%_I am Ostoth. Welcome to the Bunker._
_I am in charge of the Bunker._
This tiny woman would look like someone's  friendly old grandmother, were it not for the aura of power emanating from her, and for the Vahnatai chair she sits perfectly comfortably in.*_I am called Enla. Welcome to the Bunker._?_I was once studying dragons. Now I do research in the Bunker._
You meet a small, intense woman in short hair and black leather. Several vicious iron blades hang from her belt, and a proud expression graces her face.PShe greets you with a sharp nod of her head. _I am Elspeth. Welcome to my shop._
_Well, I run this shop with Nance. I make the best iron weapons you're likely to find, and you can purchase them, if you got the gold. You can also sell me other stuff. I'm sure I can unload it on somebody._
There is a gentle looking blonde woman with a kind face sitting at the table. She is sharpening a small knife. She smiles at you as you approach.
_I am Nance. Greetings to you._fShe shrugs. _Oh, I mainly help Elspeth run her shop. Not what I'd choose as a path, but there you go._
The bar is being tended by a thin man with short black hair, a twitchy demeanor, and a lopsided smile. He wears the traditional sash used in Exile to mark a mayor.K_I'm Crisper. Crisper the barkeep, or Mayor Crisper. Whichever you prefer._r_Well, I'm the mayor for now. Painful, but necessary. But I also run the Phoenix, which is a bit more satisfying._
There is a young man with dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard behind the counter. His fingers are permanently stained from years and years of working with herbs and mixing concoctions.
1_I am Miles. Miles the mage. Welcome to my shop._
He points to the bookshelves. _Each of those scrolls contains a recipe I have mastered. Every plant in these caves I have turned into a wondrous concoction of some sort. And I place all my knowledge at your disposal!_
There is a Nephilim sitting behind the counter chopping mushrooms. This is not too unusual - some Nephilim have made peace with humans and taken to living among them. A few, but not many.pIt's tail twitches happily and it graces you with a toothy grin. _Mrrrr. My name is Hmurrr. Welcome to my shop._
It purrs excitedly. _I make all types of foodstuffs for my good human buyers. Mrrrr. You can purchase all of them that you want, and be assured of their edibleness. Mrrr._'It stares at you perfectly impassively.#_That is beyond even my knowledge._
_I don't know about that._
_I'm not sure._-_Am I supposed to know something about that?_
She looks at you impatiently.!_I don't know about that. Sorry._
He grins awkwardly.
He shakes his head.%_Mmmmurrrr. I don't know about that._
52^rese^fort^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes, I'm a sage by trade. I was brought here to gather and study samples from the surface world. That's why being here is so boring!_X_If only I could find someone interested in my abilities._ He looks at you meaningfully.

55^gues^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Maybe down further into the caves. Or more likely, on the surface, although that would be an invitation for the Empire to attack them. The Empire despises any power it can't control, and they would despise the Empire back._
55^empi^desp^0^0^0^0^0^99

57^surf^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99

This man is intensely unappealing. He has bushy whiskers, a distracting personal odor, and wartmoss stains on his shirt (wartmoss is chewed much like tobacco). He fixes a beady eye on you as you approach.rHe hawks and spits a grayish stream at a nearby spittoon. He isn't too picky about his aim. _Call me Gointz, kid._'He hawks and spits. _I sails the lake._
This shifty looking man wanders aimlessly but quickly around the town. It takes a minute to catch up with him. He doesn't seem keen on talking to you.>He looks you over, then seems to recognize you. _Call me Asp._GHe looks you up and down appraisingly. _Just wandering. And observing._QThere is a small kitten here. It seems well fed. It is also meowing an awful lot.iThere's a name tag around its neck. It says _Spike._ When you look, it says _Meow. Mew. Mew. Meow. Meow._p_Meow. Meow. Meow. Mew. Mew. Mew. Meow._ It's a very noisy kitten. You start to wonder if it ever stops for air.
You meet a tottering old Slith, his once green scales darkening around the edges with age. It wears many amulets and teeth around its neck.9_Ssss. Greetingsss. Welcome to the Bunker. I am Pathass._xHe speaks in a shaky, sibilant voice. _At the asssking of Exile, I have come to the Bunker. I help with their research._
You meet a tall, thin, awkward looking man with curly dark hair. He is polishing a rough bar that seems to have been set up rather quickly.
CHe has a high pitched, nervous voice. _I am McDonald. Who are you?_
_I take care of the food here. That's all I do, so don't get mad at me if anything goes wrong! Lord knows everything is messed up, and I didn't do it!_dThere is a young man with short hair and a broad smile sitting at the table. He seems very friendly.
_Hi there! I'm called Foley.__He turns his smile to you, setting you at ease. _Well you know, I'm here to help build things._XYou meet a tall, solidly built worker. He's drinking mushroom beer from a slender glass.&_I'm Thompson. But I answer to Buddy._I_I've been doing a lot of surveying. That's mainly what I'm up here for._
There is a short, stout woman sitting at the bar, working on her fifth mug of mushroom beer. She looks very uninterested in your presence.
_McKinley. OK?_ she grunts.
_I'm a laborer here._^There is a short man with short hair on his hands and knees here, cementing stone floor tiles.SHe looks up at you and cocks his head. _I am McCullouch. Welcome to my work place._1_I am assembling a floor, as you can see. Alone._
There is a muscular Slithzerikai sitting on this bed. It looks like it's meditating. When you approach, he comes out of it and looks at you with unblinking eyes.-_I am Ahsoth. Greetingsss to you, humanssss._
His face remains expressionless but his eyes are filled with fury. _I wasss sent here by my people as a gesture of peace to humanssss. I help them build this city._
He grunts and spits.
_Shhh! The walls have ears!_
_Meowmeowmeowmeowmeow!_
_Sssss. I know not of that._
_I'm kind of busy now. OK?_<_Oh yeah. I really, really, really want to talk about that._
_Don't know about that._
_Huh?_
_What?_%She smiles sweetly. _Can't help you._

He hawks and spits. Twice. Then he looks at you sharply. _Interesting ya' should mention it. Sometimes I got an old boat I needs to unload. If you might be into some sort of purchase, let me know. I ain't goin' anywhere._ b_It's a bargain at 500 gold, after all. A bit steep I know, but hey, I'm the only guy with boats!_

62^secr^xxxx^23^0^0^0^0^99
_It's some secret Exile thing, I tell you. I shouldn't be goin' after it like I am, but I really want to know what's in there!_ He suddenly looks suspicious. _Wait! Do you work for Exile? Never mind! I don't know anything about anything!_CHe backs away, and looks over at the dark stone building nervously.

He looks frantically nervous. _I know nothing about it! Honest! Foley and Thompson went north to survey. We had to go look for them a few days later, because they didn't come back._
_We found their bodies, and ran for it and called for help. You would have run too! We were afraid of getting attacked by bugs at any moment._

_Oh yes, I'd absolutely love to talk about what I spend all day doing. I would really, really love that.

Like maybe I want to hear about your adventures!_
66^adve^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
He pauses. _You know, come to think of it I don't want to hear about your adventures. I want to talk about other things._ His smile remains undisturbed.

_Oh, all sorts of things. Just nothing I want to talk about with you._ He pauses, still smiling. _Wait a moment! I know something about magic!_

This woman is surprisingly small and delicate to be working in a construction site in the middle of nowhere surrounded by hostile monsters. She seems perfectly at home, however.
,She bows to you. _Greetings, fellow Exiles._WShe takes a delicate sip of her mushroom beer. _I spend most of my time on watch duty._WThere is a slith curled up here. It's clearly  miserable and almost completely dormant.WWhen you speak to it, it raises its head weakly and looks at you. _Hsska, _it whispers.\It sighs, a long, drawn out hissing sound. _Alwaysss so cold here. Can't do what they want._
This woman is middle aged, but walks with the stride and confidence of a warrior half her age. The steel sword at her side looks well worn.G_My name is Zhivanevskaya. But you can call me Commander Zhivanevskaya.[_I oversee the defense of this town, and believe me, there have been nothing but troubles._AYou meet a big, burly Slith, skin dry from the heat of his forge.$_I am Dossor. Welcome to this shop._F_I am the blacksssmith for this new city. I  run the first shop here._sYou meet a tall, heavily built mage with a pot belly. His hair is unkempt ... he clearly wasn't expecting visitors.*_I am Ernest. Welcome to my humble abode._C_It is a pleasure to meet some Exiles at last. Welcome to my home._
A huge ghast sits on the throne, gazing at you hungrily. Drool drips from its massive teeth, and little bits of blood are speckled around its mouth.;It emits a deep chuckle. _My name will not save your life._
]It runs a claw down an arm of the throne. _I have been placed here to Gorvifal to taunt you._
You meet a female mage. She's pacing back and forth, completely involved in her own thoughts. She stares intently at a vial of brightly colored slime in her hand.nShe looks up at you, but her gaze is absent. Her mind is clearly miles away. _I am ... umm ... I'm Cindy. Hi._e_I am ... oh._ She stares at the vial and thinks for a moment. _I ... Research. I am doing research._
This man looks like a sailor, but is wearing the robes of an apprentice mage (dirty and torn robes, but robes nonetheless). He stares intently into an orb on the table in front of him.
As you approach the table, he looks up from the orb. _Welcome, my children!_ he says, in an affected fortune teller voice. _Come forth, so I may speak unto you._x_Greetings, children! I will forecast your future for only 2 coins! Also, I can share with you my great magical skills!_
This innkeeper has filthy, dirt-encrusted hands, which have probably touched every mug and plate in the place. He looks you over with disinterested eyes.(_I'm McElroy. Welcome to the Rowdy Oar._
He wipes his nose with the back of his hand. _Well, we got the best drinks in the whole town. Only two gold. And we got room in the common room to sleep for the night. Only three gold. And we'll make sure none of the slimes get ya'._
You meet a woman with a sun-weathered face, loose clothes, and a sure step. Tattoos ring her arms and wrists. She gives you a cocksure grin as you approach.7She tugs her earlobe as she looks you over. _I'm Dawn._a_Well, I normally sail the open seas. Now I just wait around here.

She shakes her head.
_Ssss. I know not._
_What are you talking about?_
_Ssss. I know not. Apologies._
_What?_2He growls in irritation. _That is not the answer!_
She shakes her head.
_I don't know about that._9He wipes a glass with his bare hand, and shakes his head.
_Yeah, whatever, buddy._

71^chit^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Nasty, nasty creatures. They used to only live down with the Vahnatai. Now they're spreading everywhere. I hear someone brought a few of them up to Exile as an experiment, and they escaped and spread everywhere!_
_At least that's what I heard. Is it true? Beats me. At least they keep me in a job!_ At that, she raises her mug and takes a hearty swig.
71^life^deat^0^0^0^0^0^99

_They call them murders, but I don't buy that. Foley and Thompson went out. They got careless. They were too slow. A chitrach ate them. End of story._

_Now don't get me wrong. I got no problems with those lizards. They just shouldn't be here. They need lots of heat, and if we sent people out to forage stuff to burn, they'd be eaten by chitrachs!_"_Plus, they're terrible laborers!_
73^terr^labo^0^0^0^0^0^99

75^host^kriz^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Well, people are really busy worrying about the slimes, and they don't believe your lot is powerful enough to create them. So you're safe around here. The other provinces are a different story._

75^test^cost^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I've made teleporters that go to the five biggest cities in Valorim. A week's travel, done in an instant. Generally somewhat safe. And only 250 gold for a chance to try one of them._ He chuckles.D_Quite a bargain, eh? Let me know if you want to purchase a ticket._
75^purc^tick^21^250^85^8^1^99yYou pay him. _Excellent! The portals are around here somewhere. Help yourself! Oh, and don't play with any of the runes._

77^defe^dang^28^0^0^0^0^99
_The slimes can enter Krizsan at will. They slide though holes in our walls. I look for a weapon we can use against them, but the work is slow._ She thinks. _Perhaps you should leave, so I can work more._
_The slimes enter Krizsan at will. In fact, they killed the shipwright last week, and even have attacked this city hall. I look for a weapon to use against them. Salt didn't work. I will search more._

79^best^drin^10^2^0^0^0^99

_Oh, one will slip through the walls every once in a while, but none get in here. Sleep easy!_ He grins in a way you find not at all reassuring.
80^sail^seas^0^0^0^0^0^99U_Not much call for that now. Ships haven't been sailing since the monsters appeared._

She shakes her head sadly. _This has always been my home, but the slimes are decimating it. I may try to become an Exile._ She tugs her earlobe and smiles.  _Looking at you, it can't be that bad a thing to be!_
80^ship^mons^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Interesting thing about that. Just when the slimes started appearing, when I was sailing into Krizsan for the last time before the ships stopped going, I saw some weird lights on the coast._
80^ligh^coas^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The south coast, just west of here. There was a tower, and there were some seriously weird lights flashing around it._ She tugs her earlobe thoughtfully.
_Maybe it's just me, but the slimes must be caused by a bunch of weird magic. Well, there's weird magic there._ She grins. _But what do I know? I'm just a sailor, and you're genuine Exiles!_
80^genu^exil^0^0^0^0^0^99wShe laughs. _Don't worry! Your secret is safe with me! I was pretty close to being sent down there a few times myself!_
80^leav^figh^1^307^3^0^0^99
She sighs. _That's the problem, though. It's easy to kill one slime. Just one stab is all it takes. But they keep coming and coming, and if one gets the drop on you, and it'll hit you with a spell, or cover you with acid, or worse._Z_That's right. And if the slimes ever come back, I'll be on the front lines against them!_

A heavy set woman sits perched in the middle of the tavern, commanding everyone's attention. She plays a guitar flawlessly. When she finishes her song, she walks up to speak with you. Her skin is incredibly pale - she's an Exile!RShe bows. _I'm Gypsy. Nice to see familiar faces. What brings you to the surface?_XShe tunes her guitar as she speaks. _Oh, just touring the surface. Like you, I suppose._
A dark skinned man with a variety of tattooes and earrings is walking around, carving a belaying pin and a sharp knife. He looks like he's just swallowed a lemon.
_Hrrmmph. I'm Escovedo._
IHe laughs - a harsh, bitter barking noise. _Nothing! Absolutely nothing!_
This archer is patrolling the streets of Krizsan, longbow at the ready. He has an arrow nocked, and is ready to fire it at a moment's notice.)_Shh. I'm hunting. And the name's Ellis._i_I'm hunting for slimes._ He spins around quickly, looking for a slime. Not seeing any, he keeps looking.
You meet a young, calm woman. She wears long white robes and the ankh of a healer, and, somewhat incongruously, wears a big axe at her belt.)_I am called Terry. I'm the town healer._e_Well, I mainly act as the town healer. Busy work. Plus, I maintain the shrine, for what it's worth._
You meet a big, beefy man gleefully attacking a leg of lamb with a large cleaver. After years of chewing on mushrooms in the underworld, the smell of the food in this shop drives you wild.JHe looks you over knowingly. _I'm Herron. Proprietor of Herron's Herring._
_You all look hungry, like you haven't seen good victuals in a long time._ He winks at you. _You're in luck. Herron's Herring has the best food for sale around!_
This is one of the tallest woman you've ever seen. She looks down at you with a grinning face, as she effortlessly hefts about a huge hammer and tongs. She wears a leather jerkin, and her bare arms are sweaty and muscular.[She gives the hammer a spinning toss, and catches it. _Welcome to my Smithy. Call me Jinx!_
_Oh, well, what do you think? You can sell me what you got, and purchase weapons in return. Always glad to help a visitor to Krizsan._
You meet a very tall woman with a grim face, twisted in anger and grief. She's pounding out a sword, smashing it with a huge hammer, but her heart clearly isn't in it, and the weapon is coming out crooked.[She looks up at you vacantly, and says _I'm Jinx. Welcome to my shop._ in a toneless voice.
At first, she seems not to hear you. Then, after a moment, she begins to speak. _I have weapons for you, if you want. You can also sell me things. For what it matters anymore._
An elderly, angular man sits behind the counter, dispiritedly polishing a shield. There is plenty of armor behind the counter, which is peculiar considering the number of books in the shop."He looks you over. _I'm Benedict._O_Well, I'm a businessman. You know, this and that. Right now, I deal in armor._
The woman behind the counter looks like a buxom serving wench made good. Her demeanor and clean, stylish clothes clearly mark her as the one in charge._She mops up some beer on the counter and looks at you proudly. _I'm Kessle. Welcome to my inn._
_I run the Crusty Sailor Inn. I feel that, even in the middle of all the slimes and horror, we should still have a little luxury to get us through. We have fine beer for 5 gold, fine wine for 10, and luxurious rooms for only 15 gold. What would you like?_
You see a seedy looking sailor, walking around town looking bored. He paces over to you - it seems he finds talking to you preferable to doing nothing.5He scrathes himself. _I'm called Denzil. Howdya' do?_pHe shrugs and spits. _Normally, I'm a sailor. It's a disaster for people in my trade these days, I tells' ya'!_ 
She pretends not to notice.	_Pfaugh!_

81^tour^surf^4^25^0^0^0^99
f_Well, I've already played pretty much everywhere in Exile, so I snuck up here. Tricky, but I did it._

81^exil^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Oh, but I was tired of that place! Too damp. Couldn't keep the guitar in tune. Not so bad up here ... there's lots of monsters, slimes and such, but we're all used to that._;She strums out a short tune on her instrument. It's lovely.

_Well, Krizsan has lots of sailors. They're a superstitious lot, but not the shrine-going type. It's all I can do to keep dust off of everything._
She sighs, and looks down at the axe on her belt. _Well, I was worried about getting people to come to the shrine. Now I'm worried about the slimes. They burned through the west wall not long ago. I'm scared my shrine is the next place they'll reach._

Sometimes we get people from odd places, though. Where are you from?_c_Oh, and be sure to ask me if you want a good meal. I know just where to go._ She chuckles at this.

A wizard in dark robes sits cross legged in front of you. He looks intently at you from under bushy eyebrows, and clearly could not be less impressed.
_Names have power, child._uHe shakes his head in amusement. _I am merely observing. In this age of fury and blades, knowledge is a true weapon._
You meet a priest, wandering the streets of the city. He wears rough, woolen clothes, which look like they've been worn through muddy swamps from one end of the continent to the other. Only a small wooden ankh marks him as a holy man.3He extends a calloused hand to you. _I am Gardner._rHe fingers his ankh. _I've been wandering the lands, trying to help people deal with the monsters that plague us._|You meet a captain of the Empire army. He has a squashed, puffy face and a huge nose. He looks at you with extreme distrust.
_I'm Captain Agrod._
He pulls out a small hip flask and takes a swig from it. _I'm the Empire liaison for this area. I hope you don't plan to cause trouble._
There is an officious looking woman with a turned up nose behind the counter. Even as she looks up at you, she  continues to nervously shuffle papers with her hands.)_Valoda._ The papers continue to shuffle.X_I'm the delivery dispatcher. Even in these awful days, the mail must still go through._
You meet a small, fidgety man with the look of a natural-born bureaucrat. He sits in an impressive, polished oak chair far too large for him.gHis expression is hard to read. _Welcome, travelers, to the city hall of Krizsan. I am Mayor Arbuckle._
He has a nervous tic around his eye. _I was picked by the Empire to look after this area. It was a nightmare assignment, and the monsters have only made it worse._ He surprises you with his bluntness.~This woman hefts a large halberd around with her. Both her weapon and her breastplate have tiny spots of dried slime on them. UShe shifts her halberd to one hand and tips her helmet to you. _I am Captain Maxine._
She shrugs her shoulders brusquely. _Can't talk long. Have work to do. I look after the garrison and city hall. Plenty to do, what with the slime invasion._zYou meet an archer, standing outside the city limits. He looks very nervous, and constantly watches the ground around him.IHe moves quickly up to you, watching for slimes as he moves. _I'm Zoorb._vHe emits a brittle laugh. _I'm watching the walls, to see if slimes are burning through them. Bloody suicide mission!_
At the sight of your well-traveled band, the innkeeper starts getting bottles of mead ready. Nobody else in the bar gives you much notice.&_I'm Churdan. You folks look thirsty._
_Well, our main business here is thirst management - we make the finest mead in Krizsan. You can also get a room if you want - only 5 gold._
j9oThe innkeeper is very warty. He doesn't look like he enjoys his job, and he certainly isn't impressed with you.
_I'm Carroll. Whaddaya' want?_
_Well, I got the captain's room open for five gold. I got grog for 3 gold for a round. You're just lucky I'm servin' landlubbers._
_Your question lacks focus._%_I haven't learned anything of that._
_My duties don't involve that._
_What?_IHe acts as if he knows what you're talking about, but he clearly doesn't.
_I can't help you with that._
_I can't help you with that._
_Eh. That ain't my job._
_Shut up._
91^mere^obse^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I am simply watching carefully what happens, and who is doing what, and what is coming from where. Others can kill the monsters, and they have their purpose._

91^loca^ring^24^2500^70^0^0^99
He gladly accepts your 'dedication.' _The Ring of Endless Magery is in the Tower of Zkal. That legendary tower, I have found, is at the southern end of the island south of the city of Gale._
bHe shakes his head. _You clearly have insufficient dedication. Perhaps you could accumulate more?_
91^gale^zkal^0^0^0^0^0^99X_Gale is at the northeast end of Valorim, many, many miles from here. Have a nice trip._

A priest with a large sword sits at the bar, drinking untoward amounts of grog. She turns as you approach, and you readily see the booze hasn't affected her in the slightest. _I'm Glydden. I'm captain here._u_I'm the captain in Delis._ She eyes you carefully. _Been here for five years, since I served in the Exile campaign._rThe bar is being tended by a vigorous woman in a black leather jerkin. She has dirty blond hair and a tanned face.
_I'm Ilsa. Care for a drink?_
_We have the standard inn fare. Beer is two gold, and a room is eight. Room's expensive, but very, very nice. And not much worry about slimes._
A man with dark skin and an intense expression sits at the table, reading a prayer book. He seems strangely unconcerned that you just barged into his room. He wears ominous, blood-red robes.
_I am simply called Paulo._
_I am a humble priest, wandering the lands and spreading my teachings. For now, I have found this village a pleasant place to stay._
You meet a seedy looking archer from the Empire army. He's low on arrows, has dirty armor, and is clearly on one of his later glasses of mead. He scoots over to make room for you as you approach.._My pals call me Feral._ You aren't surprised.
_Well, I'm waiting here for my unit to get me, so we can go hunting for slimes. I'm really looking forward to it._ He rolls his eyes. _I got a lot out of my last patrol, but don't want to try to repeat the experience._
The woman lying back on this pile of filthy furs has pale green skin, silvery hair, and impossibly elegant features. She must be one of those legendary creatures - the dryads. She looks pale and ill, however, and stares blankly at the ceiling.=She turns her head weakly to you. _I am Illyree,_ she croaks.KShe coughs. _I have been taken from my forest. Soon I will be beyond help._
You meet a quiet, young woman in loose, flowing black clothes. She moves silently through the town, seemingly looking for someone.}She turns to you. _I do not say my name, except to those who fully have my trust. That is a teaching of the wise man I seek._
_I seek a teacher._
There is a nephil with all the markings and necklaces of a shaman sitting at the desk. It's writing with a quill pen, held awkwardly in its right hand. It's left hand is just a stump.KIt looks up at you with inscrutable feline eyes. _Hmrrr. I am called Claw._
TIt makes a low rumbling sound deep in its throat. _I run this flop. I was a sailor._
_What's that?_
She shakes her head.

This girl might be about ten. So covered is she by grime and ore dust, however, that she could also be any age from four to sixteen. She looks at you with interest.
_I'm Susie!_ she says.
_I'm looking for slimes!_
This man's plate armor, vicious greatsword, and epic muscles mark him as one not to be trifled with. Markings on his breastplate mark him as an Empire Dervish, a member of the Empire's elite shock troops.._I am Vorgar._ He looks at you with suspicion.U_I have been placed here to fend off the slimes. It is one of my easier assignments._
The innkeeper is a rotund woman with long dark hair. She is reading a book when you approach the bar. You have to clear your throat to get her attention.
_I'm Kelda. Welcome to my inn._w_Not too much. Not much business, what with all the slimes. I'll give you a good room for only 3 gold, and wine for 1._
This man is fastidiously cleaning, counting, stacking, and restacking several large piles of coins on the top of the altar. The coins are all shapes and sizes, and from all over.fThe man turns and flashes an unctuous smile. _I'm Kilborn. Welcome to the Temple of the Divine Lucre._|_Information in power. Power costs. I will tell you our philosophy for a single gold, and the services we offer for only 5._
This spirit seems to be struggling to remain in this place. It wavers and warps, and is so unstable you can't tell anything about its shape.
_Not important. Must help you._KThe words are a whisper. It is clearly struggling to form them. _Help you._
There is one of the nasty, brightly colored slimes sitting in the middle of the floor. It wobbles gently from side to side, but doesn't move. Refreshingly, it isn't trying to attack you.
It wobbles slightly.
It writhes and wiggles at the sound of your voice. You would guess it has been placed here for examination. The question: by who?
You meet a small woman with dark skin and long black hair. She wears the robes of a member of the Triad, and has tiny runes tattoed on her forearms and the backs of her hands. She radiates confidence and power.=She bows slightly at the waist. _I am Mahdavi, of the Triad._p_I am a member of the Triad of the Tower of Magi,_ she says modestly. _It is a post of no small responsibility._
This old woman wears long, rich, velvet robes, which trail on the floor behind her. Silver characters are sewed into the hem. She has a strange, vacant look, and doesn't seem to be sure of where she's going.
_I am called Linda._UShe looks down, and is silent for a while. Then she looks up at you. _I do research._
There is a businesslike official standing at the entrance to the portal, notepad in hand. As people filter by walking to and from the portal, he checks them off.
_I'm Vidrain._2_I'm very busy. I've received information on you._hYou meet a tidy young mage in tidy robes. Her hair is neatly combed, and a small wand hangs at her belt.	_Kyanan._%_I am a teacher at the Magic School._
_Huh?_
He shrugs you off.
She shakes her head.
1_I couldn't even talk about that if you paid me._
_Must help you._
It wobbles.
_Excuse me?_
_I don't know._
_I'm really very busy._
She looks uncomfortable.

111^rich^famo^0^0^0^0^0^991_Yeah! And then I can go to bed whenever I want!_dShe squats on the ground and picks at a scab on her knee reflectively, pondering this wondrous fate.
111^pale^peop^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yeah!_ She stops and thinks. _A lot like you. Better be careful! People might think you're from Exile, and are big monsters and stuff._

112^fend^slim^0^0^0^0^0^99y_They wanted to send two dervishes. I told them that would be overreacting. At any rate, there are few of us in Krizsan._

He frowns. _I served in Exile. I was part of a unit that was ambushed by a Vahnatai and worm patrol._ (Worms were what the Empire troops called the Exiles.)
112^kriz^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
He grunts. _The Empire has placed little of its strength in Krizsan. I know not why, but it is not my place to question the wisdom of my benevolent masters._
112^vahn^worm^0^0^0^0^0^99T_Only I and one other survived. The Vahnatai even slew the wounded. I made an oath._
112^oath^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_When all this business with the slimes is done, I will go back down there, alone or with others, and all you worms will pay. Count on it._ He clearly recognizes you as Exiles. Considering the paleness of your skin, it's not too surprising.

113^wine^xxxx^10^1^0^0^0^99jYou buy several glasses of thin, watered down wine. There's no wine in Exile, so even this is interesting.

113^colc^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The poor village was only twenty miles to the east. I say 'was'. They were hit by even more slime attacks than us. The humans abandoned the place, and the slimes took over. Nothing but ruins there now._

She looks uncomfortable. _Linda the archmage was in the Triad once. She performed a rather unfortunate experiment with demonkind, and we had to banish her from the Tower._u_Only lately have we allowed her to return, as we need her considerable skill. She seems to have learned her lesson._
117^empi^tele^0^0^0^0^0^99
She smiles wryly. _During the Empire War, our foe's great weakness was its trouble sending troops down here. They made a massive portal to teleport hordes of soldiers here._
_I directed an effort to destroy it. For this, I was thought an expert on these things, and stuck with maintaining the portal here._
117^port^ways^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The portal here was built several years ago. It was only two years ago that we were able to boost its power sufficiently to send someone near the surface.

The man sitting behind the counter is busily chopping pungent and peculiar herbs into small pieces. Shelves behind him sag beneath a variety of multicolored solutions with no doubt esoteric purposes.#_I am Vincent. Welcome to my shop._
_I make a variety of powerful potions, which are available for purchase. The Tower is an excellent place for this sort of business._
This woman is of utterly nondescript appearance: average height, average looks, dull hair. However, her robes are an immaculate white, and her face radiates peace and strength.*_Welcome, children. I am Mother Clarisse._
_I am a high priestess of the Church of the Seeking Soul. I spend my time learning, and teaching. And, when it cannot be avoided, wandering._
There is a large woman with very short hair behind the counter. She was grinding something with a mortar and pestle when you came in, and her fingers have the permanent brownish stains that are the mark of a true alchemist.LShe wipes a hand clean and extends it to you. _I'm generally called Piglet._._I am an experimenter in the alchemical arts._
This woman wears the robes of a student mage. However, she completely lacks the scraping, servile manner of an apprentice. In fact, she looks downright combative.`_I'm Carrie the apprentice._ She says 'apprentice' as if she wants you to make something of it._
_Well, I just completed my silence period, and am beginning my preparatory training. That means I'll learn something useful in, say, fifty years or so._
This mage wears a sash of office - he must be an official of some sort. He must not be working now ... he's just wandering aimlessly through the tower.
He looks you over. _I'm Conrac. I'm just the administrator. You probably want Vidrain. He's to the southwest._ He seems eager to leave.b_Oh, there's no need to make conversation on my behalf. I'm powerless to do anything to help you._
j6lThe crone behind the counter is so aged and brittle you're surprised nothing is actually falling off of her.%_Menlo,_ she says, in a creaky voice.
_Child, I've forgotten more than you'll even learn. My knowledge extends from the bottom of the sea and to the highest star. And I'll share it with you, if you ask nicely._
This spider stares at you with big beady eyes. At first, you aren't sure what it's going to do. Then it says, in a friendly, high-pitched voice, _Hi there!_ It starts to bounce up and down happily.LThe chirpy, happy voice continues. _My name is Spider! Pleased to meet you!_e_I'm here because the neato wizards here wanted to study me!_ He looks at you closely. _You're cute!_
You meet the shredded wreckage of a human being. She has grievous wounds on her arms and chest, but one look in her eyes tell you her worst damage is at a much deeper level.;Her voice scrapes its way out of her throat. _I was Linda.__She digs her torn nails into her legs, and speaks. _I failed. I brought destruction on us all._
You meet Solberg,  wearing torn and scorched robes that mark him as a member of the Triad of the Tower of Magi. He is dirty and has been burned, and is cowering back here out of the way.,_I am Solberg. Thank Heavens help has come!_
He waves at the cracked and burnt walls. _It was Linda! She tried again to summon and control the dark powers, and now we may all be doomed!_
_I can't help you._
_You confuse me, my child._'_That it outside my area of knowledge._
She shrugs.
He bites his fingernails.
?6-_I do know about that. But I won't tell you._
_You're silly!_
She doesn't seem to hear you."_Enough of that! Time is wasting!_
121^powe^poti^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Potions are the most convenient of the item magics. Great strength, great portability, and they taste great! Who could ask for more?_

121^plac^busi^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I have sold potions to the finest mages in Exile. Solberg, 'X', Patrick, and, well, others._ He seems to be debating whether to tell you something.
121^solb^patr^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Fine mages all._
121^othe^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
He looks around to make sure nobody else is nearby. _I can't tell anybody here, but listen. Linda has been buying a lot of weird herbs. They're used for other things, true, but the herbs she's been buying are mainly used for summoning._s_It's suspicious. I stay out of tower business, but you guys have enough of a name that I thought you should know._
122^high^prie^28^24^0^0^0^99)_The greatest honor ever afforded to me._hShe looks sad. _The greatest honor ever afforded to me. Alas, it did nothing to save the Tower of Magi._
122^seek^soul^0^0^0^0^0^99
_We are dedicated to the liberation of learning. Why do we not suffer the tyranny of the strong? Why do we not live exclusively in hovels, prey to giant lizards and disease? Because of learning._s_We of this church accumulate and further knowledge in all forms. Knowledge is not wisdom, but it does lead to it._
122^lear^educ^0^0^0^0^0^99
_My main responsibility in the Church of the Seeking Soul is to never stop learning, and never stop exploring. It is a great burden. Sometimes, I wish to stop and say enough is enough._2_Fortunately, the joy of teaching keeps me going._
122^teac^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Others hoard their magical skills. We delight in sharing them. Alas, we must request a fee to support our archival efforts. Are you interested in spells?_
122^wand^avoi^28^24^0^0^0^99
_Before I came here, I did service in the Empire War, healing, and even fighting. It provided an education, but one I would have been happier without._
She shakes her head angrily. _I was visiting here when Linda visited doom on my home, making me a wanderer again. The Tower of Magi is gone, and I mourn the souls lost._
122^towe^magi^0^0^0^0^0^99g_I mourn the many worthy and learned souls lost, and I pity our country for the wound it has suffered._

123^alch^arts^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I don't make potions anymore. That's Vincent's business. What I do do is try to come up with new recipes. For example, I can teach you to make Weak Poison with holly leaves, or a lovely Speed Potion with comfrey root and wormgrass._;_Might you be interested in purchasing these fine recipes?_
123^towe^magi^0^0^0^0^0^99o_The Tower has seen its share of turmoil over the years. Sometimes, dark powers have paid visits._ She shivers.
123^stil^aliv^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Apprentices learning spells. Wizards trying new concoctions.  Mages tinkering with fire and ice and acid and poison and dark powers. It's a wonder nothing has blown us up yet._
123^dark^powe^0^0^0^0^0^99RShe looks annoyed. _You should know that certain things are not asked of lightly._
125^vidr^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_He's in charge of the portal, and thus of the day to day operations of the tower. The Triad controls all the magical stuff, which leave me powerless._
125^powe^help^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Vidrain and the Triad control everything important in the tower between them. And I, the Administrator, am stuck with making sure the trash gets taken out._
125^make^conv^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Nobody needs to talk to me anymore. I just sat for hours waiting in that awful Council Room, and nobody came. So now I walk around. It's only mildly awful this way._
125^coun^room^0^0^0^0^0^99b_Let's make a room in the Vahnatai style, they said! Hah! Those chairs are uncomfortable as hell!_
125^tria^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The ever so mysterious and aloof Triad. They consider me completely beneath them! I didn't want to bring Linda back, but they didn't listen to one word I said!_
125^lind^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_'We wish the return of Linda.' they said. 'Oh, swell. She only summoned a demon lord into the Tower once, and is only mildly insane. What a beautiful idea! Let's proceed at once!' I said._~_'We appreciate your acquiescence,' they said. And that was that. Sarcasm is lost on that lot._ He kicks a wall in irritation.
124^sile^peri^0^0^0^0^0^99
_All apprentice mages here spend a year in magically forced silence. It's supposed to, um ..., 'Force us to focus our inner mind.' or 'Free us to learn without the weight of response.'_A_It's pure bollocks, of course. They just like to see us squirm._
124^prep^trai^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Now I can actually talk. That means a full year of grinding herbs for the masters while they pretend to teach us something useful. We don't learn any actual spells for two full years!_
;_I tell you, if it wasn't for Bernard, I'd die of boredom._
124^fift^year^0^0^0^0^0^99
She sighs. _Well, more like three years before we learn even a spell of the first circle. But the silence period makes it seem like much, much more, believe me._
124^bern^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
She looks upset that she let it slip, but then decides that you aren't a threat. _He's still in his silence period, but believe me, he can communicate more without words than most can with a year of talking._
She grins. _Of course, if I hadn't just spent a year being completely quiet, I wouldn't think you were worth telling any of this. No offense._
127^forg^know^0^0^0^0^0^997_Learning is my life's work. Why else would I be here?_
127^know^shar^0^0^0^0^0^99
She looks you over, and thinks. _You are the surface adventurers. I know of you. I will tell you of Erika for 200 gold, and dragons for 400. Also, I can lower myself to identifying your items if need be._>_Finally, for a scant 25 gold, I can give a friendly warning._
127^frie^warn^10^25^0^0^0^99
_Certain metals give off deadly magics, which cause those nearby to become ill. Certain magic items can do this as well. If you find yourself becoming ill for no reason, look to your inventory._/She shakes her head. _Knowledge is never free._
127^erik^xxxx^10^200^0^0^0^99
You pay her. _Erika is the boon and bane of Exile. Without her skills and leadership years ago, we Exiles would be starving and miserable, or dead. Without her hatred of the Empire, the Empire war would not have happened. Her tower is in Upper Exile._/She shakes her head. _Knowledge is never free._

127^drag^xxxx^10^400^0^0^0^99
You pay her. _There were three dragons in Exile, Athron, Sulfras, and Khoth. They went up to the surface, suddenly, some years ago. I know not why. I only know one thing ... they all hated the Empire with a passion._/She shakes her head. _Knowledge is never free._
127^iden^item^19^20^0^0^0^99vShe mutters a brief spell, gives your items the merest glance, and comes away with full knowledge of their properties.

128^neat^wiza^0^0^0^0^0^99

128^stud^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_They say I'm a Giant, Intelligent, Friendly, Talking Spider, and a neat freak of nature or something. They say they should study us before we all disappear!_
128^bugs^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Bugs are yummy, and the wizards keep a bunch around for me. Wanna' go eat some?_ You politely decline. It looks sad for a moment.
128^disa^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99r_There aren't many of us in these icky caves anymore. Most of us went to the surface, where the bugs are tastier!_
128^surf^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_We snuck there in Secret Tunnels, known only to we spiders!_ It scuttles back and forth to illustrate the sneaking part. _The spiders are up there now, living a happy, yummy life! If you see them, say hi!_
128^secr^tunn^0^0^0^0^0^99g_They're secret, silly!_ It thinks it over, and looks at you carefully. _You're cute!_ it finally says.

She inhales painfully, and speaks. _I brought demons here. I thought I could bend Grah-Hoth to my will by using my own spirit as the gate._
129^grah^hoth^0^0^0^0^0^99
Her face twists in horror. _I wanted to bend Exile's great foe to our will, to use against the Empire. I would channel him here through me. It is complicated, but I would hold them back with my own spirit._
129^spir^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
She screams, a long, wrenching keen. Her chest heaves, which, considering the extent of the burns on her chest, must be agonizing. _They used me as a gate, and ripped my soul away!

NelleThe spirit of a young man floats here, over the charred body of an apprentice mage. It stares at you.
_I was Bernard._B_Oh, you must help me. Help me if you can! I need to save Carrie!_
You encounter the insubstantial form of a middle-aged man, still wearing translucent robes and a sash of office. He motions you forward.(_I was Conruc. There was not much time._F_Hurry! I was useless in life! Don't let me be useless in death, too!_9You find a very insubstantial ghost, huddled in a corner.
_I'm dead._/_I'm dead. Before I move on, I have a purpose._
You stand before Erika, master archmage of Exile. She looks surprisingly young - only the cold, ancient look on her face belies her true age. She watches you as if you were a particularly intriguing new form of insect."_I am called Erika. Simply Erika._
_I have many jobs. I am the greatest wizard in Exile. I am a total foe of the Empire. I have an assortment of hobbies. I teach magic, sometimes. Which of these interests you?_
There is an old man behind the counter, pulling beers. He's doesn't look very strong or agile, but has several large knives sheathed at his belt. They're clearly meant for more than cooking.SHe says _I'm known as Claw Hardknife._ He looks slightly embarrassed as he says it.
_I've run this inn here for many years. We have our own brew of beer, only five gold for a round. We also have one room open, only 10 gold for the night._OThere is a mage sitting here, deep in his cups. He motions you to sit with him.0_Arion._ He takes a swig of beer. _How are you?_z_I've been stuck here for a while. Minor difficulties._ He shrugs, and drinks more. _I was going south to find a teacher.__The man at the table wears very loose black clothes. He eats a spartan meal of bread and fruit.
_I am Oralse._\_I am a traveler. Until recently, I lived on the Isle of Bigail._ He munches a bit of crust.3A tired looking woman greets you with a cup of tea.7_I'm Orseena. Welcome to my homey, rustic little home._
She tries to smile warmly, but it just doesn't work out. _I run a little bed and breakfast here.There's a nice cozy room available next door for only 5 gold. It's what I do while my hubby is away._
A muscled, efficiently build nephil stands at the anvil, carefully working an axe head. You cannot help but admire the skill and patience he is putting into working the metal.
He turns to you. _I am Mrrhrr._
_Mrrr. I do little now. The shortages are great. I cannot travel far. So I stay here, and make improvements. Also, since things are rare, if you want you can do selling._
There is a woman with robes or a mage and a growing collection of wrinkles sitting at the desk. She was writing when you came in, but stopped in order to speak with you.
_Nell. Welcome, Exiles._v_I am sort of an Exile, having had to leave my home recently. Now I do a bit of identification, and am also a scribe._

CHe says simply, _I am Ahonar, spiritual guide of the Anama church._c_What can I say? I founded the Anama church. I watch over it. I help my people in their struggles._
A wrinkled and weary woman shuffles papers at the end of the table. She looks up at you with the air of a bureaucrat, and with the sense of having become accustomed to the pointlessness of her existence.*_I am Mayor Bernathy. Welcome to Shayder._
_I am the Mayor of the beautiful city of Shayder, placed by the Empire as a guardian. For what all that is worth, which is little. _kYou meet a short, fidgety accountant type with a heavily chewed pencil behind his ear. He nods in greeting.$_I'm Grunders. A lovely day to you._
_Oh, I run a variety of business operations. I'm the main jobs dispatcher for Shayder, and I'm also an accomplished reseller. Good occupations, thanks to the roaches._yYou meet someone unusual in Anama lands: a woman wearing mage robes, and doing so unapologetically. She nods in greeting.
_I am Sara. I'm a mage._
_I study the magical arts, and provide training in the same. I even dabble in identification a bit. And believe me, between the roaches and the Anama, these are not stress-free occupations._
You meet the mayor of Shayder. She's in terrible shape. She coughs constantly, has sweats, and is deathly pale. The diseases the cockroaches brought hit her hard.
_Call me Bernathy._a_What does it matter? I was worthless before I got sick. Now the Anama truly control everything._

She scratches at a small sore on her arm. _I won't tell you what rubbish they spout. You'll hear enough of it. I'll say this for them, though. Without them, the roaches diseases would have killed many more people. The Empire was zero help with that._

Sick Boy
This man is well built and dangerous looking. His face has a dark, ferrety look to it, and he seems quite at home among all the weapons.
8_Ahm Begbie,_ he says. You can't quite place his accent.
_Ah got weapons, ya daft sod! What else would I got? I run this shop with mah' mate Renton. Also, if you wanna' sell somethin', I'm your man._]The man behind the counter is tall and thin, and has very short hair. He wears an Anama ring.
_I'm Renton._
_Oh, just trying to rebuild my life, ya' know. So I run this shop here. You can purchase armor here, finest quality, brought down from Gale._
The tattoos and weathered skin on this woman mark her as one who's seen a lot of the sea. She cleans off the bar's counter with a dirty rag in a calloused hand.<_I'm Mickie. You gonna' just gab or you gonna' get a drink?_
_Well, for fine out-of-towners like yourself, we have the luxury suite. Only 10 gold. Plus, we have a fine amber ale on tap. You gents can purchase that for only 6 gold._
A sleepy looking man sits hunched over in the corner, nursing a mug of really nasty smelling drink. He doesn't look like he wants to talk to you.	_Irvine._
_I'm enjoying my privacy._
This man has the earrings of a sailor who has been over many seas and to many lands. There's something very unusual about him: he wears an Anama ring.K_Greetings to you. My name is Boyle._ He's unusually friendly for a sailor.j_I sail the seas, a very difficult calling of late. For some time now, I have been stranded on this isle._
You meet a very tired and overworked man. He has the look of someone who's been up for days straight. He wears a mask over his mouth, and often wipes his sweaty brow. You notice he wears an Anama ring.|He speaks with you while grinding up some healing herbs. _I'm just called Jed. Sorry if I can't give you my full attention._
yHe applies a poultice to a sick woman's forehead. _I'm Shayder's healer. It's a terrible task, as you can probably tell._
You meet a withered, tired looking man in long robes. When you approach, he is studying diagrams with illustrations of cockroaches on them.
_I am Arkley. Greeting to you._Z_I am the librarian of Shayder, and one of the keepers of knowledge for the Anama church._lA young boy, about ten years old, moves quickly about the temple, sweeping the corridors with a large broom.
He bows. _I'm Deland._C_I work for the Anama! Someday I'm going to be a big Anama Priest!_
The woman behind the counter is clearly deathly ill. She is selling food, which is a tricky thing for an ill person to do. She wears a mask, and moves the food around with tongs.)She coughs under the mask. _I am Rippel._SShe leans back in her chair, barely conscious. _I am selling food. It's necessary._ZA thin man with running sores on his face moves up to beg from you. He's a pathetic sight./He coughs. _I'm called Sick Boy. Imagine that._Z_I just wander and survive as best I can. Give me a few coins? I'll tall ya' what I know._
He grumbles indifferently.
_I dinna' ken that._
She laughs. _What was that?_
He shakes his head shiftily.	He spits.
_Please, I'm very busy._
_Don't have any books on that._
He fidgets.
She stares at you blankly.#He coughs. _Don't know about that!_

_It's luxury, all right! No giant cockroaches been in there for a week!_ She shows you to your room. It's unpleasant, but basically sufficient._$_Oh yeah? And where's your 10 gold?_
153^purc^ambe^10^6^0^0^0^99
She serves up the unpleasant tasting, watered down, yellowish fluid. _Sorry we can't get anything better. The Anama make beer, but keep it all to themselves._ She thinks. _Of course, I do have a little bit of stronger stuff. Only 10 gold._
You don't have the money.

155^wand^anam^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The Anama taught me that a sword to use against others is of only limited use when the others have more swords than you. That is why I no longer use or will support the use of magic._
_To show my loyalty, I took a wand I had carried for defense for many years, and threw it through a grate into sewers, where I hope it lies still._ He looks very proud of this.

He wipes his brow. _The roaches are a nightmare, no two ways about it. So many people have fallen ill from the plagues they spread we may have to expand the hospital!_rHe wipes his brow. _The roaches have caused so much plague we've had to expand the hospital, and may do it again._

_Also, I make money on the side by creating maps. If you would like to purchase one of my maps of the island, you have but to ask. Only 50 gold._
157^anam^chur^0^0^0^0^0^99

157^magi^sara^0^0^0^0^0^99
He shows his Anama ring. _I agree with their stance on magic, though I do not dislike mages. Sara, to the southeast, is a mage but a great finder of knowledge._ 
157^impo^rese^1^307^5^0^0^99
_My current research is critical. I am trying to find ways to deal with the cockroaches that plague us. I am having little luck, but I have found a few leads._
_I am trying to find ways to heal certain diseases the cockroaches brought. Now that I think of it, it is dry, esoteric stuff. But very in line with the Anama's desire to heal as many people as possible._
157^purc^maps^22^50^2^0^0^99}He takes your gold, and gives you a neatly drawn maps. _Thank you,_ he says. _This will feed me well while I do my research._BHe shakes his head. _Even a lowly librarian has to make a living._
157^cock^lead^1^307^5^0^0^99
_Well, I have heard that there are intelligent spiders on this island. It's odd, but they may be able to help.

157^mage^purg^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I know it is problematical for an Anama member to send one to a mage, but, just between you and me, we are not yet strong enough to handle the roaches on our own. Purgatos lives in the ruined town of Kneece._<_I believe you can find a ferry there in the town of Kuper._
157^inte^spid^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes, intelligent friendly spiders. They live near the town of Bavner. Something this bizarre cannot help but be a help to us._W_To help find Bavner, by the way, you can purchase maps of the Isle of Bigail from me._

160^give^coin^10^3^0^0^0^99
He accepts the coins gladly. _Thanks, friends! By the way, keep an eye out for Judith. She's a healer who goes from town to town. I heard her say once she knows about some ancient artifact. Ask her!_
_You have no coins to give._
160^mick^anam^0^0^0^0^0^99

You meet a muscular soldier patrolling the streets of the city. Her soldier's armor has the marks of an Empire Dervish, the title the Empire gives to its strongest, craftiest warriors. When she sees you, she removes her helm and approaches.@_I'm Dervish Cassie._ She regards at you with extreme antipathy.N_I'm patrolling for roaches._ She stares at you pointedly. _And other vermin._vYou meet a woman with dark skin, long black hair, and an infectious grin. She wears an Anama ring, and healer's robes.4_I am Meena, of the Anama church. Greetings to you!_
W_I'm a traveling healer. It's tiring work, but there is too much to do for me to stop._
You meet an elder priest of the Anama church, wearing immaculate robes and taking notes in a thick journal. He seems pleased to see you.(_I'm Father Lockhart. Greetings to you._
_I am High Priest Ahonar's chief assistant. I look after the daily affairs of the church.

He looks extremely calm and quiet.AHe shakes your hand in greeting, and says simply _I am Oriathon._.He touches his priest's robes without comment.PA victim of one of the many roach diseases lies before you, dripping with sweat. Your answer is a long, low moan.8The plague victim hacks painfully, and whispers _Water._
The woman sitting is this seat was once very strong, but is quickly wasting away. She still wears her armor, though. She's an Empire Dervish.P_Dervish Cassie, reporting for duty,_ she mumbles. She seems slightly delirious.NShe seems to return to herself a little, and looks at you. _I'm dying, worms._
You meet a beggar. The ravages of disease are clear on him. He can barely move, but still manages an air of grim dignity. He wears a dirty Anama ring.
_My name is Spud,_ he rasps.x_I was a farmer. I lost my wife and my health to disease. I ask for a minor gift to feed me while I regain my strength._
You meet a tall, thin man with dark hair. He carries a polished wood case and a portable stand. When you approach, he sets up the stand and opens the case, revealing an assortment of potions.

The thing you notice most about this woman are her fingers. They're pianist's fingers, or wizard's finger. They're long and thin, and move with perfect precision. It's probably necessary in order to cut and shape the crystals that surround her.)_I'm Elspeth. Welcome to my little shop._(_I don't get visitors to my shop often._
You meet a woman wearing the robe and rings of the Anama church. She has the air of not suffering fools gladly, and the authority of a born leader.(_I am Mother Loomis. Welcome to Bavner._d_I am the guardian of Bavner. A trying job, I am sure you realize, but the faith gives me strength._
qYou meet a young Anama priestess, more than happy to take a break from looking over the fields and picking weeds.
_I'm Seela._
_I look after things. I watch the crops, patrol the woods, that sort of thing. And let me tell you, I see some strange things!_
A stolid, massive man is slouched behind the counter. He looks rather dull, but is surrounded by books on a wide variety of topics.
_I'm Voorn._
_I'm a teacher._
You meet an older spider, its brown hairs starting to be run through with wisps of gray. It has a gold circlet around its head.M_I'm Spider,_ it says, it's high-pitched voice have a tiny hint of authority.
_I'm a leader spider!_ it says.8You see a spider marching around, looking for something.8It runs up to you in glee. _My name is Spider,_ it says. _I'm hunting for yummy roaches!_VAn officious, bold spider blocks your way. It doesn't seem to want to let you go east.&_My name is Spider,_ it says somberly.^_I'm a guardian arachnid!_ it says in a proud way, and shows its fangs to punctuate the point.
You meet a large spider with big fangs, standing guard. It doesn't seem to want to attack you, however. It's just standing there, watching you with interest.
l_Hi!_ it says. _I'm spider!_ It has a cheery, high pitched voice, coming from somewhere below its pedipalps.
_I'm guarding our lair! There's mean things about._ It makes a little martial leap in the air, to convince you of its fearsomeness.
An official looking spider marching precisely around. It comes up to your waist, and looks as if it could be as threat, were it not for the unflappable friendliness of these creatures.%_I'm called Spider,_ it says perkily.;_I'm the captain spider._ It looks you over. _You're cute!_ He belches in a confused manner.
She shrugs.&_What is that? Speak sense, my child!_
_I can't help with that._
_I can't help with that._ _You're silly!_ it says regally.
_You're silly!_N_You can't go east!_ it says. This seems to be its general reaction to things.

Despite its age, it still has the bright, chirpy voice of the younger spider.6_I'm a sage spider! I record a history of our people!_
You see a giant spider, busily shepherding about three dozen baby spider, all about the size of puppies. The babies are constant source of idle, chirpy chatter.nThe nanny spider says _My name is Spider!_ Then she pulls one of her charges back to the group with a foreleg.A_I'm a nanny spider,_ it says, in a not as cheery as usual voice.LA giant spider runs up and kisses you in the knee. Then it backs away shyly.)_I'm Spider,_ it says, pleased you asked.._I'm looking for a mate!_ it says exuberantly.3A baby spider, only about a foot high, watches you.:_I'm ... ummm ..._ it thinks. _Spider! That's it! Spider!_?_Well, I'm just growing. But someday, I'll be huge and fierce!_
You meet a priestess of the Anama church. She seems quite friendly, perfectly willing to take a break from her work to speak with you.
*_I am Mother Melamed. How may I help you?_
She smiles. _Oh, I just sort of guide things here. We haven't had as much trouble from the roaches as other towns, so we just try to keep things safe and simple._vYou meet an Empire soldier. He has a nasty scar running down the side of his face, which he fingers as he watches you.1_I'm Captain Zog._ His voice drips with contempt.{_Oh, don't act so clever!_ he spits. _You think you're so smart wandering around like that! Well everyone knows about you!_QAn Empire soldier is here. He regards you with naked, barely controlled loathing.
_I am Bagzath, worms._
He seems barely able to restrain himself. _I found a way down there. I swore to slay Exiles wherever I can. Back away, or I will destroy you._ He fingers the pommel of his sword, seemingly hoping you'll give him an excuse to attack.dA stocky woman stands by the docks, looking you over. She seems pleased to have potential customers.
_I am Olga._k_I run a ferry over to Kneece. The tickets are only 30 gold. Expensive, I know, but the journey is tricky._hA withered old man watches you serenely. He sits with a pair of wands nearby, in case you cause trouble.4He scratches his nose thoughtfully. _I am Purgatos._
_I live in seclusion._VYou notice that the lizard wears a small chain around its neck, and is staring at you.4It surprises you by speaking. _I'm called Faithful._
_I'm a familiar._%_You're silly!_ it exclaims brightly.%_You're silly!_ it exclaims brightly.%_You're silly!_ it exclaims brightly.%_You're silly!_ it exclaims brightly.

_News of you precedes you everywhere you go. I can tell you about Kneece, or the Anama, if you wish. But I suspect you are most interested in the problem of the cockroaches._

A businesslike woman with a predatory gaze works the bar. She looks at your nice armor and weapons, and is clearly sizing up ways to relieve you of your money.
!_I'm Johanna. Welcome to my bar._
She lists the services in a clipped, businesslike manner. _We have fine rooms, only 10 gold for the night, and no sailors in them. Also, we have excellent whiskey, 5 gold a round._
A shifty looking man is grinding up leaves you don't recognize into powder you don't recognize. He puts it under the counter as you approach.'_Kurtz,_ he says, sizing you carefully.[He wipes some gray powder off his fingers. _I do alchemy. Safe thing to do on this island._AAn Anama priest stands at the altar. He looks at you skeptically.?_Father Gavlax._ He's clearly not pleased to be talking to you.
_I lead the few Anama in this foul place. And I'm supposed to discuss the faith with the likes of you._ He frowns. _I could be happier._EA man in rags stands at the dock, selling tickets. His feet are bare.$_I'm Volb. Would you like a ticket?_Z_I sell boat tickets to across the channel. Would you like to purchase one? Only 10 gold._
At first, you think this person is just another skeleton wandering the halls, this one wearing mage's robes. Then you realize it's a human, who just happens to be disturbingly pallid and thin.0_I am Nekaros,_ he says, in a thin, reedy voice.]_I maintain Northpoint Lighthouse,_ he hisses. _It gives me time to study my other pursuits._pYou see a horrid, shadowy spectre, lurking back in an isolated nook of the lighthouse. It looks at you hungrily.0It hisses _I have no name no longer. I just am!_
+_I wait here, for my chance for vengeance!_jA huge cockroach, about five feet long, stands guard here. It watches you closely, its antennae twitching.
_I'm Gregor!_ it says, in a cheery happy voice. It sounds a lot like one of the friendly spiders. The voice is a lot more disturbing coming from a roach.
_I'm a guard roach!_aThis huge cockroach stops gobbling down disgusting grayish material, and turns to speak with you.s_I'm Filth Spreader,_ it says happily, poking some slime with a leg and spreading it around to emphasize the point.
_I'm eating, silly!_0This roach looks very nervous when you approach.A_I'm called Slime Gobbler,_ it says, in a squeaky, nervous voice.=_I'm looking for a mate. The old one is gone,_ it says sadly.
This roach is prancing back and forth, practicing bites and lunges. Sometimes it jumps too hard and falls over. It stops when it sees you.%_I'm Spider Slayer,_ it says proudly.9_I'm practicing to defend our hunters from mean spiders!_*She seems to feel you're wasting her time.
_I can't help you with that._
_I can't help you with that._
He snivels in confusion."_And why should I help with that?_
It hisses in annoyance.
_You're silly!_
_You're silly!_
_You're silly!_
_You're silly!_

191^exce^whis^10^5^0^0^0^99
The whiskey is cheap, and burns your throat. They don't have alcohol this strong in Exile. As you choke it down, Johanna leans close. _Want advice?_'She looks annoyed at your lack of cash.
191^advi^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99

_Well, you can sell me things. I identify items. Also, for a mere 100 gold, I'll tell you where you can find fresh ingredients._

192^fres^ingr^10^100^0^0^0^99

195^unde^huma^0^0^0^0^0^99
_After all, wouldn't you rather have your existence continued in a rather mundane way than have no existence at all? Creating undead gives people more life, and is a beautiful thing!_

You see a perky cockroach, waving its forelegs and antennae about and mumbling things in its high-pitched voice. It stops, embarrassed, when it sees you.
_I'm Crud Muncher!_C_I'm trying to learn how to cast magic spells!_ it says cheerfully.
You see a giant roach, busily poking at one of the tall walls of piled trash and rotting goo. It bounces over to you when it sees you.L_I'm Doom Bringer,_ it says, it a happy voice. It waves its antennae at you.
/_I'm eating. But enough about me. You're cute!_
You meet an Empire soldier. He is clearly quite ill - his skin is pale, he coughs often, and he has small sores on his cheeks. He looks at you with instant and extreme dislike.  He coughs. _I'm Captain Sinbar._o_I'm leading the troops in this area, taking them on patrols._ He looks you over closely. _Where are you from?_OA tall, thin woman tends the bar. She looks you over nervously as you approach.-_I'm Elise,_ she says. She's clearly on edge.
_I run the Porter's Retreat. That's where you are, you know. We have a round of beer for 3 gold, and a decent room for 5._ She looks around nervously as she speaks. _Sorry. I've been a bit on edge._`You meet a small man hunched over the table, making intricate notes on a map with a feather pen.'He looks up. _I'm Kendrick. Greetings!_<_I'm a mapmaker, of course. A useful trade, in these parts._
This woman's skin is dark enough that she could pass for a surface dweller, but you immediately recognize her for what she is: an Exile. She looks nervous.
_I'm Jen. We shouldn't talk._W_I'm Unspecified Services, formerly selling food in Formello. Look, we shouldn't talk._>You meet a young priestess. She nods to you when you approach.
_I am Meiko._,_I am out spreading the faith of the Anama._
A massive, grim looking, taciturn man is working a piece of red hot steel with firm, practiced blows. When you approach, he sets the metal in the coals to keep hot, and turns to you.	_Voster._^He talks slowly and simply. _I have weapons. I can also do improvements. What would you like?_
This is the sort of man who's only comfortable when surrounded by piles of books. His eyes must be very weak - he has to lean forward to make you out. In addition to books, there are many odd items scattered about the room.`_I'm Oppenheimer._ He closes his book as he says it. A cloud of dust rises up, making him cough.$_I'm a sage, specializing in items._oA short, stocky man, mostly bald, sits behind the counter. He has several knives, and a sharp, analytical gaze.2_I am Londo,_ he says in a thickly accented voice.e_I am responsible for education in this filthy town. I teach the people who go to work in the mines._
_You're silly!_
_You're silly!_
He coughs.
_I don't know about that._
He shrugs.
_Please, I'm very busy._
_I can't help, my child._
He grunts noncommittally.
_I don't know._+_What is this? For this you waste my time?_
201^make^filt^0^0^0^0^0^99

202^feel^pret^0^0^0^0^0^99M_Yeah! I work hard on them._ It moves them around delicately. _Are you busy?_
202^busy^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99lIt sighs. _You're probably going to the Filth Factory, and won't hang around, huh?_ This seems to sadden it.
202^filt^fact^0^0^0^0^0^99R_Yeah. Filth Spreader keeps going on about it. I forget what it was like, though._
202^spre^forg^0^0^0^0^0^99<_Filth Spreader is around here somewhere. He's really cute!_
203^troo^patr^0^0^0^0^0^99wHe coughs again, and his lips are now flecked with blood. _Nothing went right since we scoured the forest a month ago._
203^wher^from^0^0^0^0^0^99
Before you can answer, he says _Everyone's talking about how there are Exiles up here somehow. We soldiers are awfully interested in this._
203^exil^sold^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Not all of us are as sick as me, and we all lost friends in the war with Exile. We get our hands on one of those worms, and they'll pay, but good. You hear me?_
203^scou^fore^0^0^0^0^0^99
_We killed a bunch of roaches on that trip. Our mage even fried a mother and a whole brood of little ones with a fireball. We must have bagged a hundred of the buggers._ He coughs again, more savagely than before.R_On the way back, we all got sick, all of a sudden like. Half of us are dead now._
203^sudd^like^23^0^0^0^0^99
_Like, overnight. We haven't sent a large force out since._ He suddenly gets woozy. _I gotta ... I gotta ... I gotta keep patrolling._ He wanders off.
You don't give him very long.

As usual, the beer is pretty lousy, and again, as usual, it tastes great to you. You aren't looking forward to returning to the swill that's the order of the day in Exile.
You don't have the gold.
204^dece^room^3^5^3^0^0^99LElise shows you to your room. She also warns you _Keep a sharp blade handy._
You don't have the gold.
204^nerv^edge^1^307^8^0^0^99
_There's a bunch of troglodytes living to the north. Yeah, troglodytes! There are still some around, and they're raiding us nonstop! The Porter's Retreat is the only place near here where merchants can be safe._ 
_The troglodytes aren't attacking here as much these days, but just when we get complacent, a new bunch always comes down to attack. Still, it's not as bad as it was._
204^trog^safe^1^307^8^0^0^99
She shakes her head. _We're well armed, but we hope Sharimik or the Empire or someone does something soon. The things are really too tough for us to fight on our own._>She sighs. _I guess I liked it better when they were extinct._
204^shar^empi^0^0^0^0^0^99@She grimaces. _Our mighty leaders. Fat lot of good they did us._

_Right. Look. There's a woman on our side. She's collecting info in Sharamik and Lorelei. You'll recognize her as an Exile. Look for her. She can help. Now go away._7She stares down into her beer and starts to ignore you.

She smiles. _I know I don't need to tell you of our beliefs. The word has spread that the Exiles have joined us. I am honored to meet you, and can offer you a piece of advice._
207^piec^advi^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The people of Sharamik, to the north, are very paranoid. Until you've proved somewhere else that you can help them with their problems, it's best to stay away. There's nothing they'd like more than to scapegoat some Exiles for their problems._
207^dang^magi^0^0^0^0^0^99
She smiles sadly. _Just look around. Magical creatures slay us, forcing us into hiding at every turn. Unless something is done about this, these problems will get worse before they get better._K_If this idea intrigues you, my church can be found on the Isle of Bigail._

Mayor Runkle{You meet a middle aged woman with long dark hair and an air of command. She wears a long, flowing, very professional dress.FShe stands and shakes your hands. _I am Delenn. Welcome to my office._E_I run the Golddale Mining Company. Challenging, but rewarding work._
This woman is piercingly beautiful, and has the air of one who is comfortable holding power. Her robes are simple and precise. She has two wands at her belt.
_I am Ivanova, sage by trade._{_I am a sage by trade._ She grimaces. _I do a lot of metal analysis. Leaves little time for my ... well, my other studies._TA Nephilim male maintains the inn, keeping the bar clean with feline fastidiousness.#He purrs in greeting. _I am G'Kar._\_Mrrrr. We have a fine room for only 15 gold. Apologies ... we have none of our usual mead._
WThe inn is run by a pale, bland man. You notice he has a bundle of tickets at his belt.:He says _Vincent,_ in a voice remarkable in its atonality.
_You can get a room for the night for a mere 8 gold. We have fine Karnold whiskey for 12 gold. Also, I have boat tickets._ His voice is so flat you almost have to struggle to pay attention.
A quiet woman with a sweet smile sits behind the counter, scrubbing clean a few freshly picked bunches of leaves. A fresh, fragrant, herbal smell hangs heavy in the air.kShe continues to clean the leaves which speaking to you. She seems to be doing it automatically. _I'm Dot._F_I know a few spells, but I'm an herbalist by trade. I collect herbs._
You meet a massive merchant, wearing fine silk clothes. He has thinning hair and a pock-marked face. He'd be very unappealing, if he didn't clearly have so much money.8He clears his throat extensively. _Just call me Mervin._X_I run this end of the Eastern Trade Route, and we're always looking for good couriers!_
You meet a slightly deranged looking little man. His rough, dirty clothes and thick boots speak of many months on the road, and he's bent over under the weight of a heavy sack.+_I'm Vlad the Light Salesman! How are ya'?_9_I'm a Light Salesman! Takes me places, let me tell ya'!_
This man is busily chopping herbs. It's an incredibly intricate procedure ... apparently, he is trying to get the all strips to exactly the same length and width. The concentration involved doesn't leave much mental room for dealing with you.:_Harmon,_ he says, continuing to concentrate on the herbs.
_Sorry. Chopping herbs._tA tired looking woman wearing an intricate gold amulet is sitting behind the desk. She has a great mace at her belt.
_I'm Commander Brooks._lShe grimaces. _Trying to keep this town in one piece, that's my job. I'm trying to deal with the basilisks._yYou meet a tired, thin old man. He sits behind the desk, contemplating a skull. You notice the skull has rubies for eyes.
_I'm Mayor Runkle._
_I'm the mayor. It's sort of a different post around here. I'm the administrator for several towns. And believe me, we have problems._3She shakes her head. _I'm afraid I can't help you._
She shakes her head.
He makes a confused noise."_I can't help you with that, sir._6_What was that, boy? What's that to do with business?_
He shakes his head.I_I'm afraid I can't illuminate that topic._ He laughs at his little joke.4He keeps chopping herbs, oblivious to what you said.(She fingers her amulet, obviously bored.
He shakes his head.

First Gremlin
Second Gremlin
Third Gremlin\You meet an aging female merchant, wearing fine jewelry and rich clothes. She looks on edge."She shakes your hand. _I am Dana._Y_Well, I run shipping up and down the east coast. Right now, we're looking for couriers._
A tall, thin, twitchy man is sitting behind the counter. He's using a rag to energetically polish what looks, to you, like a shard of broken glass.kHe stands up. _Ah! Welcome to you, stout travelers! I am Valentino! Welcome to my shop!_ He sits back down.
He's very pleased you asked. _Why, I collect and distribute all manner of wondrous items! Here is how the process works! You sell me the excess crud you don't want. I hike the price, and make it available to others for purchase. Elegant, eh?_1You meet a sour faced little man in monk's robes.
_I am Kawas._FHe looks at you coldly. _I am in charge of welcoming people to Gebra._mYou meet one of Gebra's citizens. Odd. Most people you've met in Valorim aren't this thin or haggard looking.
The person is quite quiet for a few moments, as if having trouble figuring out exactly what you asked. Finally, _I am ... a Gebran._VYou wait while the question percolates through the townperson's brain. _I ... I farm._
This man might have once been rather imposing and sinister looking. His robes are faded, however, and his hair is graying. He seems very pleased to have a visitor.
%_I am Anzovin. Welcome to my shrine!_
_I rule this temple, the Temple of the Surging Darkness!_ He emits a laugh that was intended to sound sinister, but sounds rather asthmatic instead. You notice the temple is looking rather run down, and the walls are cracked.\A beggarwoman kneels by the docks. In addition to an alms bowl, she holds a roll of tickets.
_I am Laika._vShe sneezes and wipes her nose on her sleeve. _Well, I'm a beggar, really. But lately I've been more of a saleswoman._
You meet a dryad, a beautiful, feminine creature of the woods with greenish hair and skin. She isn't as peaceful and carefree as you've heard these creatures are, however. She is distraught, and has been crying.9_I am Esselarea,_ she says, in a voice choked with grief.I_I am trying to regain my grove!_ Fresh tears begin to run down her face.*A nasty little gremlin is grinning at you.._I'm a gremlin! What use do I have for names!_XIt gives you a toothy little grin. _I should be helping you get further into the grove!_CAn unusually tall gremlin, a full 3 feet, has been waiting for you.$It says _1234._ You aren't sure why.3_6789. 2345._ You aren't sure why it's saying this.%A gremlin looks at you enigmatically.;_I don't have a name. But at least my name isn't a number!_
(_I'm here to help you rescue the grove._
_I can't help with that._
_Whatever do you mean?_
_I can't help with that._
You get a blank stare.[_Fine, ask your meaningless questions now. But remember ... one day I will RULE the WORLD!_
She shakes her head.MShe looks sad. _Please. I can't think about that when my grove is in danger._
It looks amused.
_4567?_

223^welc^peop^0^0^0^0^0^992_I tell people all the things Gebra has to offer._
223^thin^offe^0^0^0^0^0^99
He looks at you blankly. _Hmm. Come to think of it, we don't have anything to offer. Just some crops. And dull people. Fortunately, it's very easy to return to Storm Port. Why don't you?_
223^stor^port^0^0^0^0^0^99
He graces you with an icy smile. _It's a lovely town, with much to offer, and only a short boat ride away too! I'm sure you would find it much more interesting!_

224^busy^xxxx^23^0^0^0^0^993_Yes. Food. Farm._ The person vacantly wanders off.
225^surg^dark^0^0^0^0^0^99yHe grins evilly. _Yes, puny mortals! We believe the darker powers are waiting for cruel forces to rise among the humans!_
225^crue^forc^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes! These cruel forces will be imbued by mighty energy by those unholy powers, and from there we, umm ... that is to say, they will rise up, and RULE the WORLD!_
225^rule^worl^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes!_ He laughs sinisterly, turns to the altar, and notices that it's looking very cracked and shabby indeed. He turns back to you, looking embarrassed.
I_Sorry about that. This was all a lot more impressive before the storms._
225^impr^stor^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yeah. We got hit by serious storms about a year back. Building fell over. Some people died. Most people left. I had a shrine, and that's better than nothing, so I stayed. I gather herbs. And make a few undead to relieve the tedium._
225^shri^noth^0^0^0^0^0^99
He stands up straight and tall. _Yes! And one day, puny mortal, people will return and join me, and the dark powers will notice us and imbue us with dark energy, and we will RULE the WORLD! We will rend this puny globe in twain!_EThen he slouches again. _Sorry, get a little carried away sometimes._

226^purc^tick^10^12^143^9^0^99
She takes your money and hands you your tickets. You notice 3 gold, not 2, ends up in her bowl. She then says _Donate a gold to the cause, kind adventurers?_:She shakes her head. _Alas, I must insist on the 12 gold._
226^gold^caus^10^1^0^0^0^99
You hand her another coin. She says _Watch yourselves on Gebra, unless you're well equipped to defend yourselves. They're a weird lot, and not everyone who goes there comes back, if you get my meanin'._)_Good gods, lads! You're poorer than me!_
227^rega^grov^0^0^0^0^0^99

A vampire, pale, lithe, and lethal, sits in the throne watching you with amusement. It seems to be sizing up just how much blood each of you contains.
#_I am Vahkohs. Welcome to my tomb._W_Oh, I suppose I should be slaying and devouring you. But I wish to welcome you first._
Busy
A harsh looking man watches you dryly from behind his desk. His clothes are very ostentatious, and his mayor's sash is made of remarkably rich fabric. He wears a gold circlet.6_I am Mayor Knight of Sharimik. Welcome to my office._cHe looks somber. _Well, it's complicated, but at the heart of it, I am trying to maintain control._
The garrison commander of Sharimik watches you with skepticism. She seems unwilling but resigned to give you some of her valuable time.
_Commander Corie._S_I run the Sharimik garrison. Quite a job. I also help Mayor Knight as best I can._rThe man sitting behind this desk looks as close to a spider as any human can get. He sizes you up with beady eyes.(_I'm Internal Affairs Supervisor Levin._
He grins and twitches slightly. _Many tasks fall to me. I maintain loyalty. I am the chief jobs dispatcher. I am mapmaking coordinator. And I assist Mayor Knight whenever possible._
This woman has a light dusting of makeup on her face, put there to make her skin darker. You, however, immediately recognize her as an Exile. She pulls you aside to speak in private.8_I'm Sandra. Unspecified Services. Pleased to meet you._
W_I'm from Unspecified Services, like you. Heard about your accomplishments. Excellent._<The man behind the counter is busy polishing some lockpicks.
_I'm Ballard._n_I make tools. You can purchase them. And it makes me very happy._ He grins, in order to show how happy he is.gYou meet Sharimik's missile maker. He is putting the final polish on an intensely sharp throwing knife.
_I'm Isaac. Welcome.___You can purchase missiles from me. Quality goods, I assure you. Distracts me from my worries._]You meet a small girl, who's running down the street bouncing a ball. She stops to watch you.
_I'm Kelly. Hi!_
_You're adventurers, right?_\A serene looking woman stands before her altar, thinking happy thoughts. You interrupt them.
_I am Mother Ellyn._O_I am the priestess of the Shrine of Happy Thoughts. May I provide assistance?_
It looks amused.)He seems to feel you're wasting his time.
He shrugs.
._I have begun to feel you're wasting my time._
_Can't help with that._
She shakes her head.
_Huh?_
_Huh?_
She looks confused.
_I can't help you with that._

_You adventurers are such a greedy lot, so I'll tell you what. I'll let you loot my treasure stores! I'll wander off, and let you have your fun. Then, in return, I get to slay you as you try to escape. Doesn't that sound fun?_ _Now, do you agree or disagree?_

You meet a wizened old man with a carefully trimmed white beard. He sets down a thick, leather bound book to speak with you. He's pale enough to have come from Exile.._I am known to people in general as Spragins._
He takes a deep breath and thinks it over. _Well, I do magic, I suppose. That seems to be a good overall description of my activities._
You stumble over a small, middle-aged man, who is sitting concealed behind a clump of trees. He looks panicked at first, but relaxes after looking you over for a moment.7_I'm Grassi. Move in, quick! Don't let anyone see you!_
}_I'm an alchemist. I study alchemy. Be careful!_ He motions for you to join him behind the trees. _You can't be too careful!_
The man behind the counter is not at all your ordinary, muscle-bound blacksmith. In fact, he's a rather bland looking mage. He's holding a steel broadsword and looking at it with a practiced eye.
He mumbles a few words of a spell and runs his fingers over the blade of the weapon he's holding. The metal glows red hot for a moment. The man looks up at you. _Welcome. I am known as Grove._
_Well, I have a variety of high quality weapons available. You can sell me your excess goods if you wish. But my customers most value me for my magical skills._
The owner of the inn looks like someone who is young, but who has been rapidly aged by circumstances. She looks glad to see a customer.
_I'm Quinn,_ she says.
_I run this inn, and let me tell you, it's one trial or tribulation after another, if you care, which you don't. But look. We have a reasonably safe room for 10 gold. We have rounds of beer for 2 gold, and fine bourbon for 12. I recommend the bourbon._mYou meet a very pretty young woman, busy chopping garlic. The counter is covered with delicious looking food. _I'm Ginny! Welcome to my shop._
She indicates the counter in front of you. _Doesn't all of this look good? It all can be yours! I have all sorts of food for sale._ She smiles. _It's nice to have customers. It's been lonely lately._qA man sits at one of the inn's tables. The table has several shields on it, and the man is polishing one of them.
_I'm Ehrenfeld._p_Well, my shop was destroyed in a troglo raid, so I have to run my business here for now. Care to see my wares?_iThis mage is practically ready to stumble into you. It's obviously been quite some time since he's slept.
_Sean,_ he mumbles.zHe stares off into space for a minute or so while trying to formulate an answer. Finally, he says _Maintain the barriers._
You meet one of the Empire's archers. Empire archers tend to be the most skilled and lethal known, and this one looks to be no exception. However, he also looks somewhat depressed.@_I'm Sloan._ He doesn't look pleased that you're talking to him.Q_I ... I ... Wait a minute! I don't have to talk to you! I have enough problems._
You meet one of the Empire's elite archers. They are reputed to be able to put an arrow into anything, at any distance, but it seems the only thing this fellow wants an arrow put into is himself./_Sloan,_ he says, barely seeming to notice you.
_I doesn't matter._eThis man, wearing the sash and insignia of a mayor of the Empire, sits here drinking ale. Lots of it.6_I am known an Najib. That's Mayor Najib._ He belches.]He laughs. _I'm planning strategy! What do you think I'm doing?_ He takes a long swig of ale.
He rubs his chin in confusion.6He looks nervous. _Are we allowed to talk about that?_
_Sorry. Can't help you._
She shrugs.
She smiles apologetically.
_Can't help you._
_Can't help you._
#_Sorry. Were you saying something._-He doesn't say anything. He only looks upset.
He shakes his head.

_Yes, magic does seem to be a good catch-all sort of term for it. For example, I can magically identify your items, for a small fee. Or I teach spells to passing mages, for a price.

_Troglodyte patrols hit town all the time. Their mages hit us with Shockwaves, and cast spells so their fighters can fly in and cause all sorts of havoc! That's why I just hide. Wouldn't you?_

You meet a haggard woman with long, dark hair. She wears the robes of a priest over her armor, and her garb shows the wear and tear of recent combat.$_I am Empire War Priestess Shahpur._
She pats a massive mace hanging at her belt. _I help in the constant battle against the troglos. 'Tis a chore, but I have my faith to preserve me._|A man, small, wiry, muscular, and leather-clad, is looking you over. His opinion of you seems to be worsening by the moment.
_I'm Starcap._H_I spend my life educating cavenewts like you. Fulfilling? I think not._=A scruffy looking sailor type is selling tickets by the dock.
_Kurt._N_I got tickets to Farport. Fifteen gold. And that's all I have to talk about._
}A dark and mysterious woman sits behind the counter, mixing up a potion. The smells are alternately wonderful and nauseating.(_I am Zamora,_ she says in a soft voice.
_I make potions of all sorts. Wondrous things, they are._ She smiles, and tastes the brown concoction she's working on.  _Also, I work with other alchemists._nThis is a heavily whiskered man with a lot of hair growing out of his nose. He smells very strongly of horses.%_I'm Bryk. That's what they call me!_PHe snorts and takes a pull of whiskey. _I look after horses! They're my babies!_
The constant attacks of monsters in Valorim have caused the mayors and leaders to have a constant worried and edgy expression. The mayor of Scowcroft is no exception. However, he seems pleased to see you.&_I'm Mayor Scowcroft. Welcome to you!_w_Oh, I just try to deal with all the monsters as best I can. I haven't been nearly as effective as your group, though._:A wiry man sits cross-legged by the dock, selling tickets."_I'm Terry._ He scratches himself.>_Well, I have tickets for sale. To Fenris Port. Only 10 gold._
You meet a priestess. She's counting several piles of gold on top of the altar. When you approach, she scoops it all into a pouch.
_I'm Nydia. Welcome._[_I'm a Priestess of the Church of the Divine Lucre. We sell salvation at reasonable rates._
Unusually, the innkeeper has a battleaxe swinging at his side, and wears a breastplate which shows the scratches and marks of recent combat. He's so tired he can barely remain standing.
*_Barber,_ he mumbles. _Welcome to my inn._R_No booze left. Not much at all. Just a room. Only 5 gold. It's been a nightmare._
A wounded Empire soldier, victim of a troglodyte raider, lies in this bed. All you really see is a mess of bandages and dried blood.
The victim groans.
The wounded soldier turns over weakly. It's jarring to see someone so wounded and so unlooked after. There must not be enough magical healing to go around.
_Huh?_
_What was that, suck-weasel?_L_Look, I'm really happy to be talking to you. Really, really, really happy._
She smiles enigmatically.	He grunt.;He looks nervous. _I can't help. I'm really, really sorry._
_Sorry. I just sell tickets._$She looks like you're bothering her.
He shakes his head, exhausted.
The victim groans.

251^advi^acce^0^0^0^0^0^99

254^alch^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Why yes._ She smiles. _In fact, one of them was through recently. Told me of some unusual metal he'd found. He concealed a scroll with a map to it, which he told me about. Then he had the misfortune of being spitted by a troglodyte._L_In fact, for only 500 gold, I may be persuaded to say where the scroll is._

_Yeah, nothing better to get quickly from one to town to another than a horse. I even have a bunch of 'em out back, strong and healthy, and for sale._

_ He knows the spell. I can't get it out of him, but you might be able to. Now go away, please._ Highly agitated, she turns away.
259^room^xxxx^3^5^2^0^0^99pTottering, he shows you to your room. The sounds of combat continuously echo through the town. You sleep poorly.

v_I'm afraid this town will fall any day now. I'm so tired. My apologies. This use to to be a beautiful town. No more._

n10uYou meet a grim, squat halberdier of the Empire army. It's amazing how total his disinterest in speaking with you is.C_Masok._ The word sounds like it was ripped out of him with a hook.
_I'm a soldier._
A young, radiantly beautiful woman works behind the bar. She moves like a sylph, almost floating off the ground. Of course, you may only think that because the mead she's serving smells so good.DShe graces you with a dimpled smile. _I'm Adrianne. May I help you?_y_Our best room is free. Only 8 gold. We still have some of our wonderful, locally made mead. A mere 10 gold for a round._<You meet an aging woman with curly hair and a winning smile.
_I'm Laverne. How are ya'?_Q_Oh, not much. I run a little boarding house here, for people in town for a bit._~You meet a dark, hunched over, slightly deranged looking man. He holds a hammer in one hand, and a pair of tongs in the other.#_I'm Carmine. This better be good!_5He snarls. _I bet you come to purchase weapons, huh?_
This woman has soft clothes, soft hands, and a piercing, calculating gaze. She was doing a bit of accounting, but when you approach she sets down her pen.
_I'm Shirley._
_I'm a merchant. I look after the trading in this area._ Her calm, implacable, businesslike demeanor is somewhat intimidating after so many months out in the wild.9A mage sits behind the counter, polishing a dark crystal.
_I am Voltok._=_I collect and prepare crystals. It's an ideal place for it._|You meet a pale, thin, priest with worn clothes and a worn face. He looks very upset that you've intruded upon his solitude.
_I don't want you here._2_I came here to contemplate my faith in solitude._
You stand face to face with the King of the Troglodytes. He wears gleaming steel armor and a massive blade. His face is scarred and deeply lined, and his hair is black and stringy.:_I am King Vothkaro - High King of the Troglodyte People._
His voice is deep and commanding. _The scroll I had left for you told you the things you need to know about our people. We are a rootless people, we are a holy people, and we have an ancient enemy._
He grunts.
_I don't know about that._
_I don't know about that._
_I don't know about that._
_I don't know about that._
_I don't know about that._
_Leave me alone._
_I know not of that._
261^sold^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99J_Yeah. And that's all._ He turns away. What an uninteresting conversation.
261^halb^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
He looks angry that you know, and then confused, and then he thinks it over. His voice is quiet. _Look. There's this thing called the Black Halberd. It's sort of a legend. The best halberd ever made. Nobody really believes in it._
(_I sure didn't. Until I found a scroll._
261^scro^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I found it in a stump. No kidding. It's old, and it's supposed to give directions to where the halberd is. Don't believe it's real? No difference to me. I can get it myself._M_But if you want to purchase it from me, that'd be good too. Only 2000 gold._
261^purc^xxxx^149^0^0^0^0^99
262^best^room^3^8^4^0^0^99
She leads you you a nice, neat room. _Be sure to come back later for the mead! It's excellent._ She winks at you, and returns to the bar.
You don't have the gold.
262^mead^roun^10^10^0^0^0^99
The mead is rich and exquisite. Soon, your head is spinning. You hadn't realized how much you were missing out on in Exile. When you're done, Adrianne leans close. _Fresh goblets of mead will only be 5 gold. I like your faces!_
You don't have the gold.
262^fres^gobl^10^5^0^0^0^99
She fills your goblets with the ambrosia. As she does, she makes conversation. _You know, some soldiers were through here recently. They talked about having seen dragons._
You don't have the gold.
262^sold^drag^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yep. Sounds fishy, if you ask me, but they said they saw some dragons flying overhead near some mountains somewhere. Look - one of them was a captain, and they said they were going to Lorelei. That's to the north._5_If you see them and are interested, be sure to ask._
263^boar^hous^0^0^0^0^0^99
_You can have a room for the night for only 5 gold. Don't get many visitors out here. Only the odd types who want to see Carmine._
263^carm^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Oooh! He's a blacksmith, but a touchy fella'. His doors are locked, and he won't see anybody! Real odd and eccentric and stuff. But the people who come through say he's the best! Go figure._
263^room^nigh^3^5^3^0^0^99wShe thanks you and lets you into a cozy room next door. The next morning, after a restful sleep, she brings you scones.
You don't have enough money.
264^purc^weap^0^0^0^0^0^99[_Well forget it! I don't make stuff much anymore! I'm just too good. My skills are wasted!_
264^skil^wast^0^0^0^0^0^99
s_Oh, I can see a little bit of healthy pride is alien to you! Well, I stay out here and plan, and I'm proud of it!_
264^plan^prou^0^0^0^0^0^99z_I plan the truly great weapon I'm going to make. The problem is, I need truly great material. You got any quality metal?_

_Why, yes. Trading up and down this coast has been increasing at a highly profitable rate. Are you interested in making some money?_
265^maki^mone^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Well, it works very simply and smoothly. Couriers can get goods down south, bring them here, and sell them. They can then purchase the herbs we produce, and take them down to Libras and sell them._
8_Quick, easy, safe, profitable. Who could ask for more?_

266^grem^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Oh, there are plenty of spooky creatures out there. The worst are the gremlins. Fortunately, we can deal with them. We leave them milk and cookies in one of our buildings, and they eat them and leave us alone._
266^alon^buil^0^0^0^0^0^99
He looks nervous. _Just don't ask too much about it. And don't poke around too much. You aren't from around here. Just leave things be._
267^fait^soli^3^0^0^0^0^99__Yes, and you're intruding. Good day._ He waves his hand, and you find yourself somewhere else.
267^ritu^sanc^0^0^0^0^0^99
He looks nervous. _Ah. You want the ritual. An Empire priestess came to me, but she only wanted the ritual in order to sell it. That is not becoming._2_There is only one reason I do not expel you now._
267^reas^expe^0^0^0^0^0^99
He watches you carefully for any sign of your true intentions. _Yes. I speak with you because the ritual can be a powerful tool for good, and I feel bound to share it if that is how it will be used._9_So, tell me. Who do you plan to use the ritual against?_
267^empi^exil^3^0^0^0^0^99mHe shakes his head. _They are of no interest to me._ He waves his hand, and you find yourself somewhere else.

268^glow^ones^0^0^0^0^0^99
_We know little of the glowing ones. They speak to us. They made us, or so they say. They are insubstantial glowing forms, and we can tell little of what they truly are. They tell us to do things. We do them, but only because it is what we wish._l_They do not want us to fight the giants. I wish to. One khazi agrees with them. I do not think he is wise._
268^exce^wise^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The leader of the khazis is Elhioc. He believes something so heretical anyone else saying it would be killed - that we should ignore the ancient enemy and concentrate on fighting the humans.V_Alas, he is my equal. That is why I have brought you here. I have a mission for you._
268^equa^miss^21^0^28^8^5^99wHe smiles wryly. _Elhioc is wise, and the walls have ears. Let us just say he should be made to answer for his heresy._

Carson
Yukiko

Ligaya
Lyle
You meet a aging woman, whose hair is starting to be shot through with iron bands of gray. She wears the mayor's sash of Lorelei, which seems to weigh her down as if it was made of lead.
+_I am Mayor Bruette. Welcome, adventurers.___I am the mayor of the fair city of Lorelei. I am currently charged with maintaining the city._
This man is of average height and build. His appearance is nondescript in every way, except for one. His eyes are intensely bright and alert.+_I am Dwaine. I have been waiting for you._R_I am an Exile, from Unspec, like yourselves. I've been waiting for your arrival._
You meet a wizened, scholarly looking man, with a bushy beard. He has bits of freshly ground herbs under his fingernails, and green stains on his robes.,_I am Carlos, of the University of Valorim._M_I am a teacher at the University of Valorim. And very proud of it, as well._tA stocky woman sits behind the counter, polishing a new, steel shield. She looks pleased to see potential customers.
_I am Gertrude the armorsmith._Q_I'm the town armorsmith. I'm pleased to see you - things have been slow lately._
You see a man in long, flowing priest's robes, sitting behind the counter. In your experience, behind the till is a rather incongruous position for a priest to be in.
_I am Father Carson. Welcome._
Z_I am a priest of the Church of the Divine Lucre. As part of my worship, I run this shop._
A woman with dark skin and hair stands to greet you when you approach. She was intensely studying a thick tome when you entered.4_I am Yukiko. Sometimes I go by Yukiko the Learned._@_I am the chief instructor for Lorelei Vocational Technologies._
A muscular, swarthy horseman sits at the table, cleaning a bit and bridle. He wears a loose shirt, open to the navel, and is deeply, intensely tanned. It's a bit much.-_I'm Lewis,_ he says, in a deep, manly voice.
_I am a horseman, by trade. I breed and raise the mighty beasts._ A trickle of sweat trickles down his muscular chest as he speaks.
This small shop is filled with feathers. They're everywhere - floating in the air, getting caught in you hair, making you sneeze. Through the cloud you see a young woman, stuffing a bird and preparing it for roasting.'_I'm Ligaya. Sorry about the feathers._Z_I sell fine food!_ she says chirpily, while picking bits of feather off the stuffed bird.
This man must be Internal Affairs. He's surrounded by a veritable cloud of forms, schedules, and notes, which he valiantly battles with a goose quill pen.
_I'm Lyle._h_Have a seat._ You sit. _I'm Internal Affairs for Lorelei. A job of uneven difficulty, let me tell you._:She shakes her head, fingering her mayor's sash nervously.
He smiles enigmatically.
He looks confused.#She continues to polish her shield.
_I don't know about that._
She frowns at you.
He snorts.
_I wish I could help you._
_Sorry. Not in my area._
271^mayo^lore^0^0^0^0^0^99{_Being the mayor of Lorelei is currently a taxing job, I'm afraid. I have the sacred duty of maintaining it as best I can._
271^fair^city^0^0^0^0^0^99
She slumps in her throne. _It is, I'm afraid, not entirely what it was. And what it will be again. But soon the Empire will aid us, and it will rise again._
271^main^city^0^0^0^0^0^99g_The Empire has, alas, withdrew from this area. Fortunately, I am sure this is only a temporary thing._
271^empi^temp^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The continent of Valorim is under quarantine. Empire troops have not come to aid us for some time. However, I am sure it is temporary. All we need to do is survive, and they will surely come to aid us soon._
271^surv^quar^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Some of my troops criticize me for doing nothing to fight the giants. What fools they are! Anything we do may interfere with what the Empire is planning to help us! Do they not better see the whole picture?_L_That is why, if you're here for a mission, you've come to the wrong place._
271^miss^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99pShe leans forward and pats you on the arm. _Rest, stay safe, and wait. The Empire will provide. I'm sure of it._
272^exil^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99g_I don't miss Exile at all, I'm afraid. Spying up here is intensely dangerous, but I wouldn't go back._
272^unsp^spyi^0^0^0^0^0^99{_I'm Unspecified Services. Remember? Your employers? I've been gathering information and waiting for colleagues to arrive._
272^wait^arri^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes. I have things to report. A few odd facts. The leaders of the cities are confused. The Empire has quarantined the whole continent. There's a thieves guild in Lorelei. Nothing exotic._e_However, I have managed to worm out one invaluable piece of information. It's about Empress Prazac._
272^empr^praz^156^0^0^0^0^99
272^empi^quar^0^0^0^0^0^99
_It's insane! The Empire saw all the problems down here, and just up and went 'We can't deal with this.' They closed the borders, sealed up the Keep of Tinraya, and left._
272^keep^tinr^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Can't find much about that. Even asking about it is bad news. It was the biggest city in Valorim, up to the northwest. Then some monster hit it, some monster even worse than everything else, even the golems._`_The whole place was devastated, and the Empire walled it off so the creatures couldn't escape._
272^gole^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99r_Gale, to the northeast, has been bombarded by waves of golems. Nasty, nasty creatures. Don't know much about it._
274^univ^valo^28^156^0^0^0^99yHe shakes his head angrily. _The University was sacked by those foul hill giants. I had to come here to teach in safety._
s_This is the first University in all of Valorim. Small, I know, one classroom, few instructors. But it is a start!_
274^teac^xxxx^28^156^0^0^0^99b_I have lost my university, but I teach still. My knowledge of alchemy is still as sharp as ever._
_We had instructors in history, literature, and other arts. Then the instructors fled. Now we, that is, I, only teach alchemy._
274^prou^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_It is bombarded, nearly abandoned, has no students anymore, and ignored by the Empire even during the best of times. However, it is also my home, a potentially great place, and I am proud of it._
274^inst^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_There were four. Then three of them fled because of the giants. I teach alchemy now. That's all we offer. But we will be a great school one day, I'm sure of it!_
274^alch^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I have been teaching several valuable recipes. I know how to make potions that speed one up or restore magical energy. Both require wormgrass and glowing nettle._
_I can also teach how to make graymold salve, bane to diseases of all sorts. All it requires is graymold. If you want to purchase a recipe, let me know._

277^voca^tech^0^0^0^0^0^99

She pauses, to pull a small bit of down out of her eye. _When throwing rocks at the city, they often aim at birds. I think it relieves the tedium. They get collected, and I make them delicious! Sort of a tiny dividend of all the danger._$_Care to purchase some of my wares?_

She looks very sad. _Deborah was the beggarwoman who collected the birds for me. A rock got her, I'm afraid. I collect myself now. The hill giants have been hell for us all._
280^inte^affa^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes. The main thing that would concern you is that I'm the mission dispatcher. Also, oddly, I've been given a mansion to sell._
280^unev^diff^0^0^0^0^0^99
_With the giants coming and going, people mainly stay inside and don't do anything. That makes things easier. But I sometimes have to go out to serve papers and inspect things. That makes things harder._[He leans forward and lowers his voice. _It would be better if our leadership was stronger._
280^lead^stro^0^0^0^0^0^99
He says quietly _Our mighty mayor seems inclined to wait until the Empire sends help before taking action. Unfortunately, I feel help is not likely to come._ He shrugs. _But what can I do? I'm just the jobs dispatcher._
280^miss^disp^25^3^0^0^0^99yHe frowns. _I'm afraid you failed to complete a job I gave you. I won't be able to give you another for quite some time._
280^mans^sell^1^102^1^0^0^99
_The owner of Hawke's Manse, a huge, beautiful mansion at the northwest corner of town, was killed by a boulder. He had no heirs. I was told to find a buyer for it. A bargain, only 8000 gold. The only thing necessary - a purchaser._I_I'm so glad you bought the place. It was one less thing to worry about._
280^purc^xxxx^22^8000^15^0^0^99
He is clearly impressed. You pay him the 8000 gold. In return, he gives you a simple iron key. _Hawke's Manse is in the northwest corner of town. Enjoy your new home._
jHe shakes his head. _Understandable. Eight thousand gold is a huge amount. However, I can accept no less._

He raises his eyebrows. _Yes. I've heard of the recipe for Knowledge Brew, but only because Foxfire mentioned it to me. She's a bard, who travels around the nearby towns. You may want to ask her about it if you see her._

Ghost of Hawke
This woman clearly needs more sun. She's clearly been locked up in here with her thousands of scrolls for some time. She doesn't seem to mind so much.
_I am Yessenia._)_I am the official Librarian of Lorelei._
You meet a priest of the Anama. He looks you over, nodding in approval at your rings. He's a tall, distinguished man, the sort to be not at all concerned what other people think of him or his beliefs.A_I am Father Mundt. Welcome to this sanctuary, fellow followers._
L_I guard this sanctuary, a place of safety for those who share our beliefs._
When you get close, this warty beggarwoman kneels and extends her bowl. She's old and thin, and extremely brave to be out on the street like this.B_Greetings, bold adventurers! It is an honor. My name is Deborah._8She bows her head. _My farm was lost in a giant attack._
You meet a dusty man. Everything in this shop is dusty. The items, the counter, the proprietor. It's sort of like a junk shop, but some of the things actually look valuable.QHe brushes some dust off his arm, and moves up to shake your hand. _I'm Randall._M_I'm an item salesman. I'm so glad you arrived - business has been terrible._
The woman behind the counter is busy repairing a chain mail gauntlet. As she works, she occasionally looks up at you with an amused expression. She acts as if she knows much that you don't.
_I'm Kendra._}_Oh, I deal with gloves. I love gloves. They're utterly fascinating._ You detect subtle traces of facetiousness in her voice.
This man wears leather armor, with a peculiar eye insignia carefully painted on the breast. He has a sword lying across his lap, and black goo covers the blade. He looks like a tough customer.&_I am Geoffrey. Welcome to the Guild._gHe smiles coolly and rests his hand lightly on the hilt of the sword. _I control the Guild of Thieves._
You meet the commander of the guard of Lorelei. She sits at her desk writing notes and orders, but wears full plate armor while doing it. Not surprising, considering she's an Empire Dervish, the most dedicated and single-minded of the Empire's troops.
_I am Dervish Bruskrud. Have a seat, Exiles._ Meeting an Empire Dervish and not being attacked immediately is somewhat disconcerting.
She turns toward you, adjusting her breastplate slightly. _I am the commander of the forces of Lorelei. I lead us in our battles against the giants. You're probably wondering why I am welcoming a band of Exiles._
PYou meet the keeper of this small, cramped inn. You notice his leg is in a cast.7_I'm Winterhouse. Welcome to the Caring Cubbyhole inn._
_Excuse me for not standing to greet you._ He pats his leg cast. _Had a little accident. We have a nice room free. It's only 4 gold for the night._rYou see a translucent man, middle aged, standing by the pond. He's staring into the water. He doesn't look at you.
You get no response.
Suddenly, the ghost gets smashed to the ground, as it struck by something from overhead. The spectral body lies there for a moment. Then, in an instant, the ghost is standing again. Then it gets smashed again. And so on.WYou see a translucent, middle-aged man. He's standing next to a statue, staring at you.
He says nothing.1He doesn't respond. He just points at the statue.
She pretends to study her book.
_I don't understand, my child._+She shrugs, and then says _Give me a coin?_
_Huh?_
_Not my line, I'm afraid._
He looks at you blankly. She shakes her head impatiently.
_Can't help with that._
There is no response.
There is no response.
281^lore^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99r_Being in Lorelei has been hazardous for some time. Fortunately, I am generally disinclined to go outside anyway._
281^disi^outs^0^0^0^0^0^99
She shakes her head sadly. _My skin becomes painfully burned by even short exposure to the sun. I would not have chosen to spend every moment my life indoors looking after books. But then, one does what one must._+_At least it kept me safe from the giants._
281^offi^libr^0^0^0^0^0^99c_Unfortunately, my salary was recently cut. No money left for me. I have to make money other ways._D_Maybe I'll go up to Moon. They have an excellent collection there._
281^othe^ways^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I have been duplicating maps of Midori province for a little extra change. You can purchase one for only 50 gold. Also, I do a bit of identification._
281^purc^maps^22^50^4^0^0^99
The paper is cheap and the quality of the copying is poor. However, this is still a serviceable map of the city of Lorelei's surroundings.
You don't have the money.
281^iden^xxxx^19^15^0^0^0^99dShe looks your items over. _Not difficult,_ she says. _I'll tell you what each is for only 15 gold._
282^sanc^safe^0^0^0^0^0^99v_My job is to provide succor and rejuvenation for those of our beliefs who are passing through to more hostile lands._
282^beli^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Few believe as we do in these parts. Sometimes, their reactions can be hostile. That is the reason for this protected sanctuary._
282^succ^reju^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I can provide you healing, at a very reasonable rate. In addition, I have alchemical herbs you can purchase. After all, alchemy is the nature's great gift us._

_My farm, and my husband. Now I am reduced to begging while trying to regain a more respectable place. Could you please give me a few coins?_
283^give^coin^10^5^0^0^0^99mYou give her a few coins. She is beside herself with thanks. _And kind adventurers, I have advice in return!_
You have little money to give!
283^advi^retu^23^0^0^0^0^99
_I hear many rumors. In particular, I've heard there are Exiles wandering all around us! Keep your weapons close. You never know what those worms will do!_ Then, with another bow of thanks, she stands and walks off.
284^item^sale^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Here's how it works. Adventurers, looters, and other miscreants get objects, I don't care how, and sell them to me. Then others come and buy those objects from me._%_Our secret? Volume, volume, volume!_
284^sell^xxxx^13^0^0^0^0^99+He quickly appraises your identified items.

284^lead^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Nobody in charge does anything! We just put up walls to get knocked down, and absorb more punishment. Lousy for business. Just lousy._
284^volu^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99dHe sighs. _Actually, I don't sell much volume of anything. I just say that because it's fun to say._
284^reci^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
He thinks. _A recipe? No, don't know anything about ... no, wait! Lyle, at Internal Affairs, was in the other day and mentioned he'd heard something about this amazing potion recipe. Don't know anything else about it._
285^glov^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99x_Yes. You can sell me goods. Any goods. From anywhere._ She winks. _Then you can purchase my fine, high quality gloves._t_You may have heard I have other goods. I sure don't. Just wonderful, protective, warm, snug, five-fingered gloves._

286^swor^blad^0^0^0^0^0^99
He pats the sword. _Let's just say that this is a high risk occupation. I never go anywhere without the ability to kill at a moment's notice._ 
286^guil^thie^0^0^0^0^0^99}_I will not say details about the guild. I will not let you join. However, it may be to the guild's advantage to assist you._
286^deta^join^0^0^0^0^0^99
_You are not, shall we say, low profile travelers. Our guild is barely tolerated. Recruiting Exiles would be very bad for us. Ask instead how we may assist you._
286^assi^adva^0^0^0^0^0^99
He grins viciously. _Let me count the ways! I have valuable intelligence about access to Blackcrag Fortress. I know useful secrets of certain miscreants. And, most intriguingly, I can sometimes help people pretend to be members of the Anama._*_And you can even purchase tools from me!_
286^blac^fort^0^0^0^0^0^99
_It is well known that the Empire has quarantined off Valorim to prevent the monster plagues from spreading. The gateway from the rest of the Empire to Valorim is Blackcrag Fortress._j_What is not well known is that some of us have a tunnel to bring people and goods in and out of Valorim._
286^tunn^valo^0^0^0^0^0^99
_There is a tunnel through the mountains to the north. A fork of this tunnel is a secret entrance into Blackcrag Fortress. It is our tunnel, not yours,_ He grins. _but I can sell you permission to pass through it._m_Permission to pass through can be had for a scant 3000 gold. If you want to obtain permission, let me know._
286^perm^obta^10^3000^13^1^0^99
He collects the cash. _The tunnel is in a secret valley, about sixty miles east of Blackcrag Fortress. Enter, and the thieves there will explain where to go. Good luck._NHe looks very annoyed. _How dare you waste my time! You don't have the money!_
286^secr^misc^0^0^0^0^0^99
_A certain, normally successful thief was recently slain. He tried to run off with one of my packages, and suffered an accident. An unfortunate accident. Accidental disemboweling. Very sad._N_At any rate, I know where he concealed his loot. I'll tell you for 500 gold._
286^conc^loot^10^500^0^0^0^99
You pay the 500 gold. Geoffrey says _He had this weird thing for hiding loot in stables. Heaven knows why. When you find an animal pen, though, take a peek around. You might find something good._NHe looks very annoyed. _How dare you waste my time! You don't have the money!_
286^memb^anam^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The Anama are freaks, but they're sure to have a massive treasure in their temple. I can sometimes get some of the rings they use to mark themselves as members - you might be able to sneak into their inner sanctum wearing them._ @_If you ever want a set of their rings, they're only 2500 gold._

287^comm^forc^1^307^8^0^0^99
_I command my troops, all loyal and strong men and women, in the crushing war with the giants._ She clenches a gauntleted fist. _It would be less of a struggle, if our leadership were not so feeble._
_I command my troops, all loyal and strong men and women, against the giants. Their attacks have been weaker and less frequent, but still dangerous._ She clenches a gauntleted fist. _It would be less of a struggle, if our leadership were not so feeble._
287^batt^gian^1^307^8^0^0^99
_You have but to look on the streets, to walk our empty streets among shattered buildings, to see the effect the giants have had on us. But that is not the worst of it. The worst thing is the feebleness of our leaders._
_The giants bombarded us constantly. Now they only raid us occasionally. Alas, those raids still cost us dearly. And still, we receive no help from our leaders._
287^feeb^lead^28^15^0^0^0^99
She looks distressed, as if it's a struggle to say what she's saying. _Our mayor was slain in a giant raid. My Empire, that I swore to give my life to protect, has shut us off. We must fend for ourselves._
She looks distressed, as if it's a struggle to say what she's saying. _Our mayor refuses to act! She lets our people die while waiting for the Empire to aid us. My Empire, that I swore to give my life for, has shut us off. We must fend for ourselves._
287^welc^exil^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I did not serve in the Exile war, but I lost friends in it._ She shakes her head wearily. _That is ancient history. Now, only Exiles have had any luck fending off the plagues of monsters that afflict us._I_That is why I have allowed you into our city. I have a mission for you._
287^fend^ours^0^0^0^0^0^99X_That is why I have welcomed you here. If you will accept it, I have a mission for you._

288^nice^room^3^4^3^0^0^99
_Can't show you to your room, I'm afraid._ He tells you what room to go to. _By the way, when you get up, come ask me about the rumors I've heard. You're adventurers - I can tell. I've heard some interesting things._
You don't have the gold.
288^rumo^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
He grins. _I heard something very intriguing about some sort of a really valuable recipe. Unfortunately, it's sort of slipped my mind._n_Fifty gold, however, may restore my memory. If you want me to try to remember about the recipe, let me know._
288^reci^xxxx^10^50^0^0^0^99
He takes your money. _I overheard Randall, the item salesman, say something about hearing something about this incredibly rare and powerful alchemical recipe concoction thing. You might want to ask him about it._
You don't have 50 gold.
281^moon^coll^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The town of Moon is north of here, at the north end of Lake Tomor. They have a really great library. They even have spellbooks! That's what I hear. They might pay me what I'm worth._

287^dera^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Well, one fellow passing through here said he'd seen dragons. Dragons! As if they hadn't been wiped out years ago! Forget his name. He headed up to Dorngas to serve there. If you meet him, try not to get him started. He'd rant for hours!_

DaltreyiYou meet the elderly, crabby woman who greeted you when you first entered your house. She's busy dusting.
_Hi, boss. I'm Marjorie._bShe straightens up proudly to her full five feet of height. _I'm the caretaker for Hawke's Manse._
You see a bard, a wandering entertainer. However, her act is truly unlike anything you've ever seen. She is creating colored, wraithlike magical lights, and making them dance before you.IThe lights pirouette before here. _My name is lost. I am called Foxfire._
_I make beauty._`You meet a middle aged woman, deep into her fourth tankard of ale. She looks blearily up at you.
_I'm Mia._+_I'm drowning my sorrows. Why shouldn't I?_
You meet the trainer of Malloc. He's an educated Nephilim, a rarity in the cities of the Empire (or anywhere). He sits patiently and alertly, ready to increase your skills.
_I am Mrrrr._RHe purrs. _I am the trainer of Malloc. I don't have many other interests, really._
This man looks like yet another Empire citizen, a harmless and hard working farmer. Then he walks close to you. He clearly wants to speak with you.+_I am Kagan. I'm glad to meet you at last._b_I know I don't look like it, but I'm an Exile! Unspecified Services! I have information for you._
This man has a kind, but weary face. He wears priest's robes, has an ankh around his neck, and carries a well worn walking staff.
_I am Kirchner._a_I am a travelling healer. In these dark times, I'm afraid there's a great need for my services._
This man walks only with great difficulty. It's easy to see why. He has a heavy bandage around his chest, and struggles to carry a massive backpack.-He sets down his pack, and says _I'm Alonzo._
He opens his pack, revealing racks filled with small, liquid filled vials. _I am a potion salesman. I'm from Appleton. I only narrowly escaped._
A wizard of the Empire army patrols the town, looking carefully for breaches in the walls. He stops so you can talk to him, but doesn't stop watching the walls.
_I am Macitar the wizard._
_I command the garrison of Dellston. I repair the walls when they get broken._ He turns to you, and fixes you with a steely gaze. _And I have little love for Exiles._
A lithe, lethal looking man moves smoothly through Dellston, alert for giants to fight. He turns to look at you. He looks somewhat deranged, at best.
_I am Durning!_
_I fight giants!_
You meet an Empire soldier. Although he wears chain mail, he clearly is not a melee fighter. He is small, old, and twisted, with pale, chalky skin and a cold gaze.
_I am Commander Daltrey._5He smiles thinly. _I wish to speak with you, Exiles._9She grumbles. _You're wastin' my valuable cleanin' time!_BShe smiles enigmatically, and makes the strange lights dance more.
She takes a swift swig of beer.
_I can't help with that._
He shakes his head.
_Sorry. I'm just a healer._
_Sorry._
He shakes his cowled head.
He remains quiet. _I know nothing of such things._

292^beau^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
She makes the colored lights fly and dance in a wondrous, intricate pattern. It's truly hypnotizing. At last, alas, the show ends for the moment. She says _My faith inspires me to bring people joy._I_Alas, to bring people more joy requires food for me. May I have a coin?_
292^coin^xxxx^10^1^0^0^0^99UShe thanks you sincerely, utters a prayer, and begins to make the lights dance again.

292^give^paym^22^500^16^0^0^99

297^appl^esca^0^0^0^0^0^99vHe looks at you sadly. _Appleton was a town to the east. I say was. The giants sacked it. It's rubble now. Many died._DHe looks down at the bandage. _I only got out with a serious wound._

He thinks, grimly. _I have little love for Exiles, but much love for teaching magic. Also, I know you fight the same foes as us. You may purchase a few of my spells, if you wish._

The inn is kept by a middle aged, pleasant, matronly looking woman. The battle axe strapped across her back looks out of place, but she seems comfortable with it.9She grins warmly. _Call me Rita, ducks. Get comfortable._E_Oh, I run the inn. Soldiers and refugees need a safe place to stay._
You find a human prisoner, a warrior from the Empire army. He's only dressed in rags now, but in good shape otherwise. He jumps up to greet you.+He shakes his head. _No time for chat now!_T_I'm so relieved you're here! I was afraid I was abandoned. Can you help me escape?_
You meet a female Empire soldier, stripped down to rags and half starved. When you enter the cell, however, she leaps to her feet.=_What does that matter? All that matters is that you're here!T_I'm so relieved you're here! I was afraid I was abandoned. Can you help me escape?_
You meet a sage, busily at work writing and revising reports and drawings. You look at the drawings - they're all of a bizarre looking beast with eight legs.iHe looks up from his work, and self-conciously wipes some ink from his fingers. _I am Raye. Have a seat._u_Well, I'm the town sage. That's how I make my living. But to be honest, right now I'm preoccupied with my research._hYou meet the innkeeper, a short, stout man with lots of hair coming out of everywhere. He seems on edge.
_I'm Radewitz._
_Running this inn. While it survives, anyway. I can give you a room for only 3 gold. Good rate. Also, for what little they are worth, I sell maps._
You meet the innkeeper. He also wears the mayor's sash of Calloc. It's not surprising ... most of the mayors of these small towns have to work at a regular job.9_I'm Rabellino. Welcome to the Beautiful Town of Calloc._
_Well, we have fine luxury rooms for only 12 gold for the night, and delicious steaks for five gold. Or,_ he says with distaste, _are you here on mayor business?_ZYou meet a mage. She looks very ill, but still works doggedly on a long, intricate scroll.8_I am Black. Welcome._ She coughs heavily into her hand.IShe coughs. _Excuse me. I'm not well._ She coughs again. _I teach magic._
A small, depressed looking man sits at his desk, stitching together a torn vellum page in a thick tome. He seems pleased that his library has received a visitor, but not very much.
_I am Yar the Librarian._3_I run the library of Wainscotting. Such as it is._gA tall, brutish man, with the earrings and tattoos that mark all sailors in these parts, runs this inn.
_I'm Abruzzo._
He spits into a rag, and used it to wipe off the counter. _I got rooms and booze. Rooms are 20 gold, for you. Booze is also 20 gold, for you. Got a problem with that?_sYou meet the mayor of Marish. He is sitting in his office, the common room of the town inn, looking at some papers.UHe straightens his mayor's sash, and rises to greet you. _I am Mayor Yale of Marish._
H_I am mayor of Marish. I do the best I can, considering the hard times._
_I don't know about that._
_I don't know about that._
_I don't know about that._3_Alas, my great knowledge doesn't extend that far._
_Beats me. Want a room?_
_I don't know of that._
She chuckles condescendingly.9_I can't help with that. Maybe it's in one of our books._
_Huh?_6_I am bereft of knowledge with regards to your query._
301^sold^refu^0^0^0^0^0^99hShe shakes her head. _Poor lambs. What can you give them, besides a kind word and a safe place to rest?_
301^safe^plac^0^0^0^0^0^99
She looks embarrased. _Mercy me, where are my manners? You don't want to jaw, you want to rest! We have a clean room for only five gold. No alcohol left, but we do have good coffee. Only 1 gold!_
301^clea^room^3^4^4^0^0^999She shows you to your room, chatting happily all the way.
You don't have five gold.
301^good^coff^10^1^0^0^0^99
_Here you are, lambs._ The coffee is black, acrid, bitter, and leaves a thick residue on the inside of your mouth. It's perfect.
You have absolutely no money.
301^perf^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^990Strong enough even for a computer game designer!
302^reli^aban^0^0^0^0^0^303
_The Empire has done so little good against the giants, I thought there was no hope of rescue! Now that you're here, there's hope! Can you help me escape?_
302^esca^resc^159^0^0^0^0^303
302^empi^xxxx^0^0^0^0^303
You get a skeptical look. _You are with the Empire army, aren't you?_ Then the prisoner shrugs. _Oh, what does it matter, just as long as you can rescue me._
304^sage^livi^0^0^0^0^0^99n_I sell little bits of info. On farming and such. Nothing interesting. However, I can also do identification._
304^iden^xxxx^19^50^0^0^0^99PHe looks over your items. _My rates are very reasonable. Only 50 gold per item._
304^preo^rese^0^0^0^0^0^99\_Yes. I am trying to find out as much as I can about the Alien Beasts that threaten us all._
304^alie^beas^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes, that's what they're called. We can think of no better name. You'd know one if you saw one. Five feet high at the shoulder. Six legs. Pure muscle. And utterly lethal._9_It was them who managed to destroy the Keep of Tinraya._
304^utte^leth^0^0^0^0^0^99
y_One is a match for ten strong soldiers. They tore through the walls of Tinraya itself! They're even worse than dragons!_
304^keep^tinr^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The Keep of Tinraya was to the north. It was the mightiest and well defended city in Valorim. Its walls were thought to be impregnable, until a hundred of the alien beasts found their way inside. Not many survived._?_It's a sad tale, but, for once, the Empire reacted correctly._
304^reac^corr^0^0^0^0^0^99
_It was a brilliant move. Footracer Province, in which the keep was, was surrounded by a wall. A dozen wizards came from the Empire and cast many spells on the wall, so that, instead of keeping invaders out, it held the monsters in!_._Unfortunately, this is a temporary solution._
304^temp^solu^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Walls crumble. Spells fade. The beasts are still in there. If something is not done, they'll get out, and keep spreading. Hopefully, someone in Blackcrag Fortress will figure out what to do soon._
304^blac^fort^0^0^0^0^0^99
_They are the ones who determine who gets in and out of Footracer Province. They are the ones who determine our fate. Unfortunately, they have withdrawn._
304^with^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99x_Nobody has been in or out of there for months. Valorim is quarantined off. Some fear we've been abandoned to our fate._
{He shakes his head. _So I study the Alien  Beasts, and look for a weakness. And, to be honest, I don't think there is one._
305^runn^surv^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The Alien Beasts may come down at any moment and kill us all._ He looks around nervously, then says _But I don't know much about that. Ask Wray ... he works nearby. He knows much more about the things._
305^room^rate^3^3^5^0^0^99
He looks relieved. _After the Alien Beasts came, nobody who can help it comes up here. Glad I can finally rent a room._ He shows you to a clean, slightly dusty room.
You don't have 3 gold.
305^maps^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yeah, I used to do good business selling maps of Footracer Province, to the north, to passing caravans. Then the Alien Beasts destroyed the whole place. Now my maps are useless._?_You can purchase one for only a gold. How's that for a price?_
305^purc^xxxx^22^1^9^0^0^994He gives you a map, pausing to blow the dust off it.
You have no gold.
305^alie^beas^0^0^0^0^0^99y_Don't know too much, just that they're lethal and will kill us all. Ask Wray the sage ... he knows a lot more about it._
306^luxu^room^3^12^3^0^0^99\He shows you to your room, which is anything but luxurious. You pass an uncomfortable night.
_That's 12 gold, Bob._
306^deli^stea^10^5^0^0^0^99gThe steaks are stringy and tough. Still, they're far better than the rank lizard meat you get in Exile.
_That's 5 gold, Bob._
306^mayo^busi^0^0^0^0^0^99
He grumbles. _We could use more adventurers around here. The army deserters cause no end of trouble. And worse, we had the trouble with looters and raiders._
306^loot^raid^1^228^9^2^0^99i_We've had lots of trouble with people coming in and stealing our food. Are you interested in a mission?_O_We haven't have many looter problems lately, except for deserters, of course._
306^miss^xxxx^160^0^0^0^0^99
306^neph^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Nephilim. Barbarians. The scum of the earth. The less of them there are, the better._ He looks you over suspiciously. _No offense._
306^empi^dese^0^0^0^0^0^99
_What with all the monsters everywhere, some of our so called protectors are more than willing to turn coward and run, looting and stealing the possessions of good citizens._!_Gut 'em all. That's what I say._
307^coug^well^0^0^0^0^0^99T_I came here from the Isle of Bigail._ She says this as if it answers your question.
307^teac^magi^0^0^0^0^0^99~She coughs again. _Don't worry. I'm not contagious. I don't think. Anyway, you can purchase mage spells from me. If you want._

307^isle^biga^0^0^0^0^0^99

307^dise^roac^0^0^0^0^0^99__I don't know anything about what's going on there. I got away, and that's all there is to it._
308^libr^wain^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Ah, it was a beautiful idea. Ships coming south, coming north, many staying here, most having a few books I could buy. I got books from all over, and kept them here safe. Then the disaster happened._
308^disa^happ^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Plagues of monsters. Valorim was quarantined. No ships from far-away lands. No new books. Nobody wanting to see or buy the old ones. I sit here bored, waiting._
308^bore^wait^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I sit around, waiting for someone like you to come appreciate my work. Feel free to peruse the books. You're adventurers ... you may find something to interest you!_
309^prob^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99'_Well, I just don't care._ Nice fellow.
309^room^xxxx^3^20^2^0^0^99|He takes the gold and gruffly shows you to a cold, dirty room. He leaves before you can complain. Resigned, you go to sleep.
_Where's your gold? Get bent!_
309^booz^xxxx^10^20^0^0^0^99
You buy some acrid, oily liquor. You have to drink it quickly, before it eats its way through the mug. Your intestines scream for mercy.
_Where's your gold? Get bent!_
309^secr^vagr^2^158^9^0^0^99
You ask him about Vagro. He grins. _Ah, those were the days. Looting, a little piracy. We took a bunch of our loot, and hid it under a statue in this town called Greendale. Then the word got out on us, and we couldn't get it!_LHe laughs. _Sure it's not there anymore. Someone must have found it by now._
310^mayo^mari^0^0^0^0^0^99r_A great honor. When I was too old to be a sailor, this is where I came to settle down. They liked me. Here I am._
310^hard^time^1^128^9^1^0^99
_Monsters. What else does anyone have to worry about? Monsters. Undead and giant lizards are harassing us from the north. That's why we've been looking for some adventurers._
_Well, the monsters are gone, but we still have to deal with the utter lack of ships coming from the rest of the Empire._ He shrugs. _We'll survive._

This man is polishing a small statue when you come in. The shop is filled with all sorts of unusual and uninteresting items, from all over Valorim.
_I'm Udell._
_Welcome to Udell's Miscellany. We have things ships bring from all over. Sell me your stuff, and purchase new stuff to carry around!_vYou meet a Vahnatai, carefully studying a book written on mica sheets. It's amazing - what's a Vahnatai doing up here?
She stands, and bows elaborately to you. _I am being pleased to see you. I am named Bohen-Ihrno._ You know 'Ihrno' marks her as a wise person among her people.
_I am being pleased you be having you here. We were knowing Exiles were up here, but were not expecting them to be visiting this site._ She has the odd syntax normal among Vahnatai.
You meet a Vahnatai, very strange considering the rarely ever leave their deep caverns. He looks extremely ill, like being near the surface doesn't agree with him.
He pants. _I am Abra._WHe looks up at you. His eyes are glazed over. _I and Bohen do missions for our people._
You stand before the legendary, secretive Athron. She is dark gray green, eighty feet from tip to tail, and completely lethal. She also looks undecided about whether to kill you or not.UShe snorts flame, and speaks in a voice deepened by centuries of life. _I am Athron._RShe idly gouges the floor with a claw two feet long. _I raise my brood, in peace._
You encounter the dragon Khoth, one of the most learned and secretive members of dragonkind. He is reading a scroll, carefully holding it in his claws. You have to wait five minutes for him to finish it before he deigns to speak with you.BHis voice is raspy, and laced with contempt. _I am Khoth, humans._Q_I study and learn. And the rest of the time, I meditate on my hatred of humans._
You stand, quaking, before a specimen of the largest and mightiest species on the planet: a dragon. Sulfras, queen of lizardkind, towers before you, staring at you with ancient, fiery eyes. She breathes deeply, and the thick sulphurous gas makes you gag.x_I am Sulfras._ Her words are slow and majestic, and when she speaks you can easily see her multitudes of massive teeth.
z_I lead the return of the dragons to the surface world. I have allowed you to enter so we can speak of important matters._
He looks confused.
_I am not understanding._
_I am not understanding._
_Why do you waste my time?_+_I know of that, but will not speak of it._
_Speak clearly, fool!_

_The Alien Beasts are malevolent and sly. I can slay them, but I fear they may still sneak in and take my broodlings. In the middle chest nearby, you can find metal which may make a weapon to kill them. That is all the help I can give._
_You took the metal. That is all the help I can give you. Good luck to you. I have little but contempt for humans, but you are the best of a wormy, weak lot._

You find a small, wiry man standing and waiting outside the city walls. You only notice him when you get close to him - it's like he has some sort of weak concealment spell.
_I am Pasi._a_Well, these days, it's difficult to enter Gale. I give assistance in doing so to those in need._
The innkeeper gives you a knowing wink when you approach the bar. She seems to know how you entered Gale, and how illegal your presence here is."_I'm Langley. How may I help you._
_Well, I would be honored in you would stay in one of our luxury rooms. Only 20 gold, for such, well, intriguing guests. In addition, for such as yourselves, we have a variety of unusual services._
The innkeeper here wears a hefty greatsword at his belt, and seems prepared to leap over the bar and break up a fight or fight a golem at any moment. He has a variety of scars.
_I'm Cole, the innkeeper here._
_Bourbon is 8 gold for a round. A room for the night is five. And don't bug the customers. We keep to ourselves here. Remember that._
A large woman with a blank face is sitting at the table. She isn't drinking or eating or talking with anyone. She just sits at an empty table, waiting.
_I am Alba._
_Just waiting._
You meet a middle aged priest. He's a massive man, moving comfortably in his armor with a great mace hanging from his belt. However, it's plain to see weariness is eating away at him, bit by bit.8_I am simply called Zachariah. Welcome to my sanctuary._
_It is good to see fresh, bold faces in this battered town. I will give you assistance however I am able. However, I am afraid I am growing rather tired._
SYou meet the woman who runs this grim place. She moves smoothly up to you and bows.EShe grimaces. _I prefer not to say my name. I'm sure you understand._"_Why, I sell refuge. Or strength._7You meet Gale's alchemist. He looks at you skeptically.
_I am Nantier._PHe says tiredly _I don't make herb. I don't have herb. I am a simple alchemist._
This woman is clearly a mage. However, you aren't sure how much you should trust her. She seems constantly distracted, and her eyes look glazed over.
_I am ... I ... I am Velnas._oShe thinks. _Excuse my distraction. I am a bit tired. I am Gale's mage. I teach spells, and do other services._
_I don't know about that._
_Huh?_
_Can't help you with that._
_Can't help you with that._
He looks confused.
She looks uncomfortable.2He doesn't seem to know what you're talking about.
You get no response.
321^diff^ente^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The leadership in Gale is currently, shall we say, less than inspiring._ He looks you over carefully. _That is why I will give you, entirely free of charge, a warning._

She shows you to your room, which isn't luxurious in any sense of the word. Still, it is safe place to stay, in a very unsafe city.O_Ah, but without the proper payment, I cannot be expected to serve you, can I?_
324^unus^serv^0^0^0^0^0^99
She points at a woman sitting in the corner. _If you're here for medicine, she will help you out. Very reasonable prices. If you're selling goods you may have obtained somehow, I pay excellent rates._
324^sell^good^13^0^0^0^0^99
324^medi^xxxx^23^0^0^0^0^99
Annoyed, she leans close and lowers her voice. _Careful! That stuff is still illegal, and Mayor Rali will have our heads on a stick if it pleases her. You want the stuff, ask Alba over there about medicine. Don't talk to me about it anymore._
_In fact, just get away!_
325^bour^xxxx^10^8^0^0^0^99rThe drink is neither strong nor good. As you choke it down, Cole says _By the way, you should be careful in Gale._
You don't have 8 gold.
325^room^nigh^3^5^3^0^0^99
You pay the money, and he shows you to your room. As he leaves, he says _And be sure to come back for a drink in the morning. Sometimes I chat a bit with the paying customers._
You don't have 5 gold.
325^care^gale^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Mayor Rali is losing it. Sealed off the city. Talking about the golems is asking for trouble. He's jealous of anyone who can fight them, and resents anyone talking about them because it points out how little good he's done against them._2_You're lucky. Wouldn't tell this to just anyone._
325^luck^anyo^0^0^0^0^0^99

_Only the best, brought at great difficulty and expense from the Isle of Bigail to here. You can purchase some from me. The effects are extraordinary._
326^effe^extr^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Everyone in town uses it. Or if not everyone yet, soon. Just the thing to relieve the fear of the golems. It's especially good for soldiers and adventurers. Doubles your strength. Erases your fear!

_There is a force up in Tevrono, a town to the north, that has had much success against the golems. However, they stand alone. Our mayor refuses to support them. If you wish to battle the golems, you should go up there and see what they're doing right._
327^skri^herb^0^0^0^0^0^99

RoseleiRThis man quickly stuffs a package in his pocket when you approach. He bows to you.&_I am Master Kalen. Greetings to you._}His face twitches suddenly. He looks pained. He still manages to talk. _I am the trainer for Gale. Would you like knowledge?_pThis shop is run by a grim, pale woman. She sits at her counter, sharpening a small, finely made throwing knife.
She says simply _Stern._[She continues to work on the knife. _I'm the fletcher for Gale. I have fine missiles here._
The proprietor of this shop is proudly polishing a beautifully made steel helmet. He holds it up to let it gleam in the light. Then he turns to you.2_I'm Dharas, armorsmith of Gale, he says proudly._
_Even in these troubled times, Gale's armor is still some of the finest in the world. Surprisingly, I still have some items in stock, which you can purchase if you have sufficient money and taste._
You find a vacant, bleary-eyed man, holding sway over a dusty and disused forge. When you enter he makes a clumsy effort to look professional.$_I am weaponmaster Asp,_ he mumbles.z_You can purchase from my stock, and I do improvements,_ he mumbles. A tiny bit of drool forms at the corner of his mouth.
A beggar runs up to you, drops nimbly to his knees, and raises his bowl. His fingers have light green stains, and his eyes are glazed over.G_Thank you for being so kind as to ask. I am Gelahd, kind adventurers._
_I've heard of you. You are great and bold. It is an incredible honor to meet you. And, if you would be so kind as to give me some gold, maybe I can aid you._
You find the most pathetic, bedraggled Nephilim you've ever seen. Her hair is scraggly and missing in patches. One of her fangs is broken off. She holds a begging bowl. It's a horrible sight.1She walks over to you on her knees. _I am Hssrr._LShe emits a raspy purr. _Oh please, great ones. Please give me a few coins._
n7\You meet a tall sailor, who seems resigned to pacing back and forth restlessly by the docks.]She seems pleased to be able to talk to someone, in order to break the monotony. _I'm Carol._:_I'm trying to get out of here before the golems kill me._uYou meet a Nephilim male. He wears a earring and sword hanging at his belt. He watches you nervously as you approach.
2_I am Mrrurr._ He looks around, alert and on edge.-_Mrrr. I am a sailor, stranded in this town._
You find a mage of the Empire, decayed to a horrifying extent. She lies back on the filthy bed, the corners of her mouth crusted with herbal potion. She mumbles incoherently.1Somehow, she manages to hear you. _I am Roselei._*She mumbles. _Oh, Edward. Oh, oh, Edward._
_What of it?_
_What do you mean?_
_I don't do that._
_I can't help with that._
_Give me a few gold?_
She purrs confusedly.
She looks confused.
He shakes his head.
She stares glassily at you.

_Golems fire spells over our walls constantly, and we need missiles to fire back, and that's all I know about it. Anything beyond that is beyond me._

He grabs a hammer and gives it a few practice swings. You can see that not all of the skill has drained out of him. _I've lost a bit lately, but I can still make a blade sharp enough to cut steel. If you want something augmented, let me know._
334^augm^xxxx^20^2^0^0^0^99QHe looks your weapons over, and gives you prices to improve each non-magical one.

_An honor, I tell you, to meet such heroes, such colossi, standing astride our troubled times. Such heroes, I'm sure, are greatly rich, not only in wisdom but in gold._ He looks at you hopefully.
335^give^gold^10^10^0^0^0^99
He takes 10 of your gold. _Thank you so much. And for 100 gold more, I can tell you something very interesting about the golems._5He looks disappointed. _You are even poorer than me._
335^gole^xxxx^10^100^0^0^0^99
He takes the money gratefully. _In the herb house there's a mage. She's always there, always not quite awake. She mumbles. And sometimes she mumbles about golems!

335^herb^hous^0^0^0^0^0^99v_I'm not supposed to say. It's here in town. You're so bright. You find it!_ He suddenly seems very eager to get away.
336^give^coin^10^5^0^0^0^99VYou give her a few coins. She bows silently to you in gratitude. Or perhaps abasement.
5You have too little to give. Her head bows in defeat.
338^gole^kill^28^19^0^0^0^99
She looks ruefully at the burns running down her side. _Just happened a few days ago. God, I want to get out of here. This city is pathetic. Their leaders are worse. I just want out before I get really unlucky._
_There hasn't been a ship out of here in months. God, I want to get out of here. This city is pathetic. Their leaders are worse._

338^herb^stup^0^0^0^0^0^99
She shakes her head and spits in disgust. _It's madness! It's great for a while! Really makes you stronger! But then it wears off, and the pain grabs your soul. Some of the soldiers take it before combat. What a price to pay!_
338^lead^wors^0^0^0^0^0^99
She smiles wryly. _You know, I could say how the town's leaders are mad, more concerned in making themselves look good and omnipotent than in saving the city. But then I'd disappear and never be seen again._!_So I won't say that. All right?_
339^sail^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I came here serving on a ship, but now the ship won't leave because there is nowhere for it to go. So instead I bought a skiff with my savings._

339^kind^neph^0^0^0^0^0^99

339^skif^savi^0^0^0^0^0^99
He shakes his head and makes a hissing noise. _It was good for nothing. The leaky thing could only get to the island to the south._
339^isla^sout^0^0^0^0^0^99
_That is useless to me. The island to the south is overrun by undead, and may well always be. I wish to get rid of the worthless boat, if possible._
339^wort^boat^0^0^0^0^0^99
His ears perk up. _I would let you purchase the skiff for only 100 gold. If you were odd enough to want to see the undead island, that is._
339^purc^xxxx^21^100^16^8^1^99]He takes your gold gratefully. _The skiff is at the end of the central dock. Thank you much._]He shakes his head. _You haven't the gold. I am sure I can be finding a purchaser somewhere._

She suddenly starts to cry. She stares in your direction, but doesn't see you. _You cannot fool me. My Edward was slain. He is gone. Go away, and leave me to what little poor peace I can find._ She turns spasmodically away.
340^gole^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
Her eyes open wide. She struggles desperately to attain a few moments of coherence. _Yes! Yes! Before Edward left me! I had to tell people! I met a mage. In mountains. North of here. Southeast of Tevrono. Must fly to get there._mWith a final exertion of energy, she says _Go to him. Met him. Knows golems._ Then she sinks back, exhausted.

A bleary eyed man sits behind the counter, surrounded by neat packages of rations. He doesn't even bother to conceal the bottle of green liquid he's been drinking.._Uh, I'm Mario._ He takes a sip from the vial.@_Uh, I have food._ He seems annoyed that you're distracting him.
Despite the niceness of his shop and the quality of his clothes, this man's essential scruffiness cannot help but shine through. He is polishing a small blue crystal.<_I'm Vagro,_ he says in a raspy voice. _Welcome to my shop._9_I run this fine crystal shop here. Feel free to browse._
You meet an older woman, who looks something like an evil grandmother. Her smile is cold, and her skin seems stretched tight over her face. She is surrounded by bits, bridles, and other horse riding gear.
_I am Craswell._6She graces you with a pinched smile. _I breed horses._
You meet a young woman who is busy nursing. She motions for you to wait a minute. When the child is fed, she sets it on the table and turns to you./She nods. _Greetings, adventurers. I am Malka._
She sighs. _I am fleeing Gale._
This man's robes are stained from heavy travelling, and his pack seems about to burst open from all the scrolls and books in it.
_I am Vairlas the sage._G_I am a sage. Unfortunately, there are few services I can provide now._
You meet a merchant, resplendent in velvet robes and silver jewelry. However, he has a wasted, haggard look and traces of something green crusted on the corner of his mouth.)_I am Corin,_ he says in a slurred voice.
Suddenly, he becomes very cheery and energetic. The transformation is eerie in its speed. His voice is slurred, however. _I run the Mernia lumberyard!_
You meet a tall woman in priest's robes. She radiates the poise and strength of only the strongest and surest of Valorim's holy people. However, she also seems very weary, and her upper arm is bandaged.
_I am Priestess Sydow._8_I travel Monoroe province and provide healing and aid._
The vigorous, hawkish man wears the robes of a wizard. However, the robes are decorated not with the usual runes or sigils, but with the insignia of a commander in the Empire army. He looks you over appraisingly.<_I am Commander Maertok. You can call me Commander Maertok._G_I know of you. You are adventurers. Welcome to our troubled province._oThis wizard is truly ancient. You're almost afraid something is going to fall off of him while he talks to you.
_I am McElton the wizard._
He grunts, and says angrily, _I make magic items. Same as I've done for fifty years. And if you came to get me to leave, it ain't gonna' work!_
The innkeeper is incredibly busy. He's cooking the next meal, serving drinks, and keeping everything clean, and he almost seems to be doing it all simultaneously.
_I'm McClain,_ he pants.
_Sorry. The inn is completely full. Keeps me busy. I have a little bunk you can rent. Only two gold. I also have rations. Popular items, those._
He doesn't respond.
He looks at you shiftily.
She coughs.
_Mmmmm?_"_What is that of which you speak?_"_Can't help you with that. Sorry._"_Can't help you with that. Sorry._"_Can't help you with that. Sorry._"_Can't help you with that. Sorry._"_Can't help you with that. Sorry._

342^stor^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
He chuckles. _Oh, you don't want to hear the stuff I was up to. Though once, I was up to a bit of larceny with an old dog named Abruzzo. We got a big pile of loot, and he took it all and fled west._dHe grins mischievously. _If you ever meet him, mention my name to him. It'll sure give him a start!_

343^anam^xxxx^1^4^0^2^0^99
_We believe that magic is a demonic art, and its use will lead you into Hell. I strongly suggest you repent.

345^gole^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99

345^purc^xxxx^10^50^0^0^0^99
He takes your gold. _Thank you. This will be a great help on the road. Now let's see. Golems. Golems are magically animated statues, very strong and resilient to damage. Gale is currently under constant attack by large groups of them._2_This is, as you can imagine, incredibly bizarre._
345^incr^biza^0^0^0^0^0^99
_A single golem is normally extremely difficult to make, and yet here we are, being set upon by large groups of them. Someone bearing great magical power must be responsible._i_I can also tell you there are several varieties of them, and that we know the direction they come from._
345^seve^vari^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I know of four. One has four arms, each ending in blades. Two fire fire and cold bolts respectively. And a fourth can shoot massive bolts of energy._
_Also, some soldiers say they have seen golems flying overhead, powerful gray creatures with a demonic aspect. I take there reports seriously._

345^dire^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99

346^herb^gree^23^0^0^0^0^99
He suddenly turns away, upset.
346^mern^lumb^0^0^0^0^0^99
He laughs. _Of course, the Empire has quarantined all of Valorim, so our wood sits here, worthless except as termite food! But what does it matter? Everything else is so interesting!_
346^matt^inte^0^0^0^0^0^99
He giggles. _Why, when seen from a distance, a golem's fireball is a beautiful thing! And their bolts of ice leave wondrous, elegant tracings through the air!_ One side of his face twitches slightly.A_And if everything falls apart, we can go to the Isle of Maddok._
346^isle^madd^0^0^0^0^0^99]_Just across the water to the east. Covered with all sorts of undead. Isn't that just ducky?_
346^duck^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes! Ducky!_ His cheeriness is starting to turn slightly manic. _Why, if we don't want to be carved up with the golems, we could move over their and have our souls devoured! Ducky is the best word I can think of for that!_ >He laughs, a raspy, ghoulish sound that makes your skin crawl.

You meet one of the Empire's seemingly endless supply of bureaucrats. She has the haggard look that comes with long periods of much work and no sleep.
@She shuffles idly through a thick stack of papers. _I am Alzon._
_I am in charge of supply for large parts of Monoroe Province's internal structure. In addition, I am the jobs dispatcher. If you would like some courier work, let me know._
You meet a wizard, currently living a hermetical existence in the mountains of eastern Valorim. However, he doesn't seem reclusive or unhappy to see you. In fact, he seems very pleased and relieved.#_I am Zalifar. Welcome to my home._l_I live up here, experiencing my wizardry and the joys of flying. Alas, I see many of this land's troubles._
You come face to face with Dalakros the drake. You can see he is a thinning creature, and his scales are beginning to lose their sheen. It is slowly starving.
_I am Dalakros._,It looks at you with naked hunger. _I hunt._
This massive man wears the armor and insignia of an Empire Dervish, although he doesn't seem to be in physical shape for melee. This must be the infamous General Baziron.
He stands to firmly shake your hands. _I am General Baziron. Welcome to Tevrono._ His voice is deep and rough, and his skin is weathered. He has the look of a man who has spent most of his life outdoors.{He sighs. _It has fallen to me to lead our forces against the golems. We, I'm afraid, are their only effective opposition._4A man sits alone in the empty inn, working on a map.#_I am Ozmo. Nice to see civilians._0_I'm a mapmaker. I'm stranded here, I'm afraid._
You meet Tevrono's weaponsmith. She is almost frantically busy, struggling to keep up with the demands of supplying the soldiers in Tevrono.$_I'm Tenuta,_ she says breathlessly.

n10kThe man behind the counter seems unfriendly in the extreme. However, he is at least willing to talk to you.*_Bad question. You can call me Velasquez._
_You're very lucky. We were expecting you. Just follow the rules, and everything will be happy. A room is 50 gold. A drink is 25._pYou are welcomed to mighty Blackcrag Fortress by a small mousy man, probably a valet. He seems terrified of you.5_I am Seymour._ He adds, nonverbally, _Don't hit me._
jHe shifts his weight nervously from foot to foot. _I was, well, left to wait here and give you a message._
This shop is filled with foul smells, vials and gourds cover every available surface, and the proprietor's hands are covered with grisly, permanent stains. Must be an alchemy shop.
_I am Howar._
_I am the alchemist for Blackcrag, here to do major research._ He looks you over appraisingly. _I also have a few recipes I teach on the side._
There is a woman sitting at her desk, holding a powerful looking glass in her hand. She is examining a huge cockroach. She pauses, however, when you enter.
_I am Petrie. Greetings._)_I am doing research on this vile beast._EA dour mage sits at his desk, examing a vial filled with ocher slime.
_I am Shane,_ he says grimly.a_Well, I did have a booming business. But I had to interrupt it, when I was forced to come here._mYou stumble upon one of Blackcrag Fortress' large number of serving wenches. She is clearly terrified of you.
_I'm Prosise,_ she stammers.w_I'm ... I'm ... I work in the kitchen._ She stares at your faces intently, recognizing the paleness that marks Exiles.
Unsurprisingly, Blackcrag has its own small forge. The woman running it looks extremely capable. She looks you over. It's clear she recognizes who you are, and equally clear that she doesn't care.
_I am Winn. Greetings._j_I'm helping prepare the army for its assault. Though, I often do some tasks on the side in the meantime._
kAn officious bureaucrat stands by the door to the throne room, waiting. He sniffs slightly as you approach.2_Chief Valorim Liaison Vladimir, at your service._;_Waiting for you. I assume you wish to see Empress Prazac._
You stand before Empress Prazac, leader of the Empire, the sworn, eternal foe of Exile. She seems strong, but not cruel, alert, but not nervous, skeptical, but not hostile. With a simple, regal movement of her hand, she motions you forward.
_I am Prazac, Empress of the Eternal Empire, Scion of Pralgad, Highest Lady of  Vantanas, Mistress of Valorim. Welcome to Blackcrag Fortress._
_I am the Empress of the Empire. I am here to deal with this horrible mess. What else is there to say?_ Her voice is calm, measured, utterly confidant. She bears the near absolute power she bears very well.
_Quiet._
He cowers.
He shrugs.
She shakes her head.SHe seems like he's going to say something about that, and then thinks better of it."She edges away from you nervously.#She scratches her arm thoughtfully.
He smiles enigmatically. She arches her eyebrows regally.

_That leads me to why I allowed you to see me._ She pauses, and steels herself to say what she is about to say. _We need Exile's help. Exile defeated us. Exile is the only force that can destroy the monsters too._^_I have an important offer to make to Exile. That is why I have a diplomatic mission for you._

Terak	Bon-Ihnro
Town Guy
Town Guard
n10*A smiling, shiny faced you man greets you.
_I am Terok. Welcome to Erox._`_Well, not much. I just look after Erox, what's left of it. I can offer you little hospitality._`Bon-Ihrno, hero and figure of legend, sits slumped in his chair before you. He looks very tired.
_I am Bon-Ihrno,_ he rasps.FHe sighs. _I fight insanity. And, joyously, my battle is almost over._8A dark, embittered man sits at the bar, waiting for you.
_Jeff. What's it to you?_>_I'm here to tell you my whole life story. What'd you expect?_
You meet a guard.
_I'm a guard._!_I'm a guard,_ he says helpfully.
He shrugs.
_I know not of that._
_Bite me._
_Up yours._
371^erox^left^0^0^0^0^0^99
`_We're a port village, pretty isolated as you've seen. We depended on the ships that passed by._
371^ship^pass^0^0^0^0^0^99^_They brought goods, and paid for use of our little safe haven. Then the quarantine happened._
371^quar^happ^0^0^0^0^0^99
_No ships can go from here to the rest of the Empire. No more ships means no more supplies coming here. No supplies, no Erox. Most people abandoned our little village._
371^aban^vill^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Can you blame them? No supplies, and no ships? Totally isolated? Vulnerable to whatever nasties may be out there?_ He waves towards the woods to the north.
371^vuln^nast^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Never knowing when one will wake up to feel the teeth sinking lovingly into your throat? That's if you're lucky! Now the gazers, they'll delight in your agonies for days, before mercifully devouring you. No, I can't blame people for leaving!_ He laughs.%Terak seems to have a real dark side.
371^litt^hosp^0^0^0^0^0^99
He grins toothily. _The inn has a room you can rest in if you want. The northern one. I sleep in the southern one. And, if you're interested, plenty of wine got left behind._
371^plen^wine^0^0^0^0^0^99
Your mentioning this pleases him immensely. _It's so lonely to drink alone. Some of the finest wine you'll ever taste is in the chest behind the bar. Help yourself!_
372^figh^insa^0^0^0^0^0^99
He slumps further in his seat. _I wish to assist you in your assault on Rentar and her minions. I wish it was not necessary to turn against my people. But I must. This revenge madness has consumed them._
372^joyo^batt^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I am old, and tired, and the side I has chosen is a small and losing one, and my foes are too many. Too strong. And, to top that, I have been assisting you. Soon, there will be a finish._
372^fini^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99`_I wish not to talk of that. Instead, let us speak of the insanity that has consumed my people._
372^reve^madn^0^0^0^0^0^99
_The Empire stole three of our Crystal Souls, our leaders, our Gods, the most beloved of us all. I cannot express what a horrid shock this was to us. In the thousands and thousands of years of our recorded history, no such thing had ever happened._%_That theft led to all this warfare._
372^warf^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Our leaders have convinced themselves that destroying the thieves, the Empire, will make them safe. They are wrong, of course. Nothing can do that. And the war will only ravage this world and cause millions of needless deaths._3_And that, brave humans, is why I must assist you._
372^rent^mini^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Rentar-Ihrno is our greatest mage. She is our most powerful mage in the last millennium. He skills were what defeated the Empire in their war with you. The monsters were her creation._<_Unfortunately, I sometimes feel her mind has departed her._
372^depa^mind^0^0^0^0^0^99
_She is like your archmage Erika. Hatred of the Empire consumes her, to the conclusion of all else. I respect her. I respect her skills. But the revenge madness has made her a danger, and she must me stopped._
372^empi^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Some of the Empire committed a grievous crime against us. Those people paid with their lives._ He shakes his head. _Why then must the entire surface be destroyed? It make no sense._
372^assi^assa^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes. I have been trying to project myself to you for months, to give you advice and aid. Here are supplies and rest for you. Most importantly, I have the most vital information to give you._
372^vita^info^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yes. Rentar-Ihrno's fortress is to the southeast. It is where she performs her mighty alchemy to make the monsters. Her rituals are both powerful and delicate._
372^powe^deli^0^0^0^0^0^99
_She molds the monsters - the slimes and roaches and golems and troglos and giants and beasts. She makes them, using a powerful alchemical spell._
372^powe^spel^0^0^0^0^0^99
_She has four vats of magical, powerful liquid stored in vats under her tower. It is poured along trenches into one massive central vat. There, it mixes. She casts the final spell, and life emerges._K_It is magic of power beyond my comprehension. However, it has a weakness._
372^weak^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_When one, two, or three fluids mix, it can be shaped. Four, however, are too much. If all four liquids reach the center, and the magical machines which energize the liquid and make life are activated, the explosion will destroy her fortress!_
_Alas, there is the problem._
372^prob^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Once the liquids are in the vat, the controls to activate the magic are by Rentar-Ihrno's throne. To reach it, you will have to elude her._
372^elud^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
He looks concerned. _I'm afraid that will be your problem. I cannot help with that. I wish you the best of luck in your assault. And, if you wish, there are rest and supplies for you here._
372^supp^rest^0^0^0^0^0^99
_I have set up a room where you can sleep safely. There is also a supply room, where you can get some useful potions. Were I not forced to be secret, I could help more._
372^secr^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99
He looks incredibly sad. _My people wish nothing to do with one who will not join in their revenge madness. I hide here, and oppose them. It is just a part of the misery that has become my life._
372^erik^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99g_Another female suffused with power and consumed by hate. These two titans of magic fill me with fear._
373^life^stor^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Yeah. Isn't that what everyone's supposed to do? You walk in, some random weird looking heavily armed people from the Empire's enemy, and I'm supposed to just spill my guts to you. Right?_'_It's so implausible it makes me sick._
373^impl^sick^0^0^0^0^0^99m_I didn't want to be in this game. It's shareware, for God's sake! I wanted to be in a nice commercial game._
373^comm^game^0^0^0^0^0^99
_Like Daggerfall! That would be awesome! Not much dialogue, but high exposure! Great for good roles! Or Diablo! Or even Ultima Online! Anything with a nice shiny box._
_Whatever. Blah, blah, blah._
373^blah^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99S_Oh, just go on and finish the game. You're close. I'm going to work on my resume._
373^resu^xxxx^23^0^0^0^0^99H_Betrayal in Antara. Love to be in that!_ You leave him to his daydream.
374^guar^xxxx^0^0^0^0^0^99x_I'm a guard,_ he repeats. This is just an uninteresting, interchangeable NPC. Lots of them around. Nothin' to see here.
